I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and
everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I
always thought I would wait for THE movie.And this is IT!When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like
a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it
would become a classic. And I'm sure it will.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so
beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan
decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey
(actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can
feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is
filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual
environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part
of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just
found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great
Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot
more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand
how epic they are. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning
atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be
lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey,
begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I
have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not
for the past ten years).Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I
discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince
me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since
that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I
exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even
unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is
just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very
important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many
different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne
Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create
some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine,
Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The
special guest, I will call him ""X"". His role, which could be seen as a
minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once
again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just
try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize
everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did
it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With
Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what
I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and
astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it.
During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science
fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is
laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema
is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my
friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some
things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make
the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that
exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about
humanity, about us.Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about
humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly ""X"", will managed to
convince you about that.My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a
beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say ""we
can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare
Nolan to Kubrick"" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people
don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And
Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't
think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie
Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought.

I am a Nolan fan but, and perhaps that's why, I see Interstellar as a
failed magic act. The multi-layered surprise and amazement that we have
come to expect of Nolan's films did not deliver. I believe this
particular film, like Prometheus, failed due to the maker's inherent
desire to create an epic - it took on too much, tried too hard and did
it all wrong. I'm willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of artistic creativity,
assume space suits and modern telecommunication systems pass unscathed
through black holes (and really, who knows?) but there are things that
cannot be excused with the budget and resources at the disposal of this
genius film-making team (such as bad script and poor plot planning). IDEA / PLOT The overarching idea is good, if not new. I found it hard
to feel amazed by the (too many) plot twists. Ultimately the
combination of all of them was tepid. We were expecting Murphy to be
older than Cooper midway onwards. Murphy's brilliant solution leading
to mankind's escape from earth failed to awe. Firstly - a massive
stretch on the Morse code / quantum data, secondly - the two
laugh-out-loud ""eureka"" moments - and thirdly, the ""aha"" factor on
seeing the new, curved reality space station was completely missing
that feeling - ""aha, so that was it, that's what it was all about"".
More failures - Matt Damon segue and the very overdone ""ghost""
revelation.SYMBOLISM / KEY TWIST The portrayal of the time dimension within a
three dimensional world in the form of the undulating bookshelf wall
was beautifully rendered. However everything else about that scene felt
wrong - the space-suited Cooper - would he have stayed in exactly that
form inside a singularity even if future advanced beings - them / us -
have helpfully carved him a neat 3-D nook in a 5-D world? This needed
exploration and some complexity. The continuation of his radio
communication equipment felt way too convenient, the whole frantic
scene ""explained"" again by the unexplained rush that's a hallmark of
this film.So, although the symbolic setup was good, I had to work hard to suspend
disbelief - to get Cooper to the back of the bedroom wall and have him
throw out clues using gravity and love as forces transcending
dimensions - why back of the wall? Why not front? Why did the
space-time continuum stop him there (that you can't go back in the time
dimension, does not explain how he could gravitationally interfere with
that particular room - in the past - and why he couldn't, I don't know,
leave a Morse code message to himself well before all of this happened?
Also, why his daughter? We get no clue in the first part of the film
why this duo in particular is chosen, the only hint to Murhpy's future
proclivity for the sciences coming from a penchant for decoding Morse
and Michael Caine's all- forgiving view of her as a""firebrand"" or
something such.)PACING / DIALOG Plot pacing was terrible (variously too slow and too
fast). Dialog was terrible. It would have benefited from further
revision and thought around how to present this particular story to the
layman. I found myself wondering how an actor of Matt Damon's caliber
did not just wave a huge red flag when he had to say why Prof Brand
knew the mission would fail -""because he could not reconcile quantum
physics with the theory of relativity"" (not a direct quote). Even if he
isn't a physicist. The only lines I can still recall liking in the film
are by Dylan Thomas (also overused).PRESENTATION I write this with only an armchair enthusiasm for physics,
familiarity limited to the most dumbed-down works of Stephen Hawking. I
found most of the science concepts used very trite - wormholes, black
holes, relativity, time dilation - trite because of their portrayal as
convenient plot tools. Having agreed in an extreme and completely
unexplained hurry to leave his family behind perhaps forever, we then
find out that Cooper needs to be told these concepts one at a time
using, at varying moments, a folded paper pierced by a pen,
oyster/pearl metaphors, and a suddenly-presented love interest for Anne
Hathaway (that plot point on love being an unexplained force was
particularly deeply unconvincing). I understand some of the angles
needed to be explained to most people, but Nolan has done hard things
more elegantly in the past. That is where one expected Nolan to
deliver. As things were it made you wonder the entire time why this crew was the
best of humanity. Murphy's law, indeed.ACTING Matthew McConaughey's drawl was sporadic and seemed unnecessary.
His character did not convince me either that he was the guy who is
most capable of being spontaneously recruited for an urgent NASA
mission (and what if he had refused?), nor that he was the guy who
loved his daughter in a unique way that transcended dimensions (or more
so than anyone else), nor even as a suitable candidate to return from
this odyssey with all its shenanigans through black holes, gyrating
space stations and a cracked space helmet (!) We never know his history
well enough. Anne Hathaway and the rest of the crew were no more
impressive. Michael Caine was convincing, but ultimately confusing, as
his confession left more questions asked than answered. TARS stole the show, and should have had more lines.EFFECTS / SCORE The effects were not comparable to Gravity. I wondered
why their spacecraft was not equipped with the basic equipment to check
metrics / giant waves / frozen clouds / landing conditions when any
commercial satellite today will do that for you and tell you where you
are to a foot's accuracy. But, details.The score was beautiful, and one of Zimmer's best. What a waste.

The universe is full of fascinating facts. It's mind-bending to
contemplate, for example, the awesome size of our galaxy. Light travels
186,000 miles per second and yet it takes 100,000 years for a single
beam of light to cross the entire Milky Way Galaxy. And our galaxy, to
quote Carl Sagan, is only one among billions and billions. The vastness
of space truly is stunning.But thanks to a ""worm hole"" the folks in Interstellar leave the Milky
Way in a cosmic snap of the fingers. And yet, having just achieved this
most amazing of all feats, our heroes are pretty much bored to tears.
Instead, everybody is more concerned with some father/daughter
relationship that wasn't developed in the first place.Look, if you're going to make a movie that purports to explore the
fascinating mysteries of the universe, then do it! Have some wonderment
in the story. Dazzle me not only with visuals, but with amazement at
the astonishing scope of our universe. And why not produce a script
that obeys the laws of astrophysics, or at least some theories thereof?This movie takes something that would dwarf the Apollo lunar missions
and turns it into some ridiculous ""Plan A/Plan B"" tediousness. I
suggest instead watching ""Through the Wormhole"" with Morgan Freeman or
re- watching ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Heck, even ""Contact"" with Jodie
Foster is far more entertaining and imaginative than Interstellar. And yet. . .9.2 stars!I'm not saying 10-star reviews on this site are phony; after all, major
film critics also are raving about Interstellar. Unfortunately, I find
most professional film critics about as credible as the physics in this
movie.Frankly, Interstellar is a boring movie! And if that puts me in the
vast minority of reviewers, fine, I can live with that. Because I have
minimum standards when I pay $11 for admission and $8.50 for large
popcorn.Stay home and read a good book instead, or just gaze out at the night
sky and reflect on our amazing universe.

(((WOW)))...!!!It's almost impossible to put in words, but we have to try and give
everyone what he truly deserve.In my modest opinion, Interstellar is the best Sci-Fi in human history.
Believe it or not. It's the simple and the complicated, It's the usual
and the different, It's the mind and the heart, It's an emotional and
psychological journey through the unknown which has its own stunning
visuals. It's an original story and thought-provoking masterpiece.Every single time with him, you just got crazy about his ideas,
astonished by his mind games and inspired when he talks to the heart.Back then, he was an ambitious young director. And with his
capabilities made his own way straight through the world. Now, he is an
icon and a legend of directing. He is Christopher Nolan...Really guys, what's wrong with this guy ?!! what's going on inside his
head ?!!It's our job to honor the honorable. Please, Just keep the rating UP,
why ? Because Chris. and Interstellar deserve it.

this movie was awful, I was deceived by the fake rating. it was full of
pseudoscience, so superficial and boring. every single minutes could be
challenged by a science professional. being a PhD student in science, I
envy SciFi script writers and directors that they can pop up any
bullshit and be praised by non-professional audience. such a ridiculous
robot, underground NASA that launches billion dollar projects in famine
a condition, the huge tide on that planet without considering the depth
of water, entering the black-hole unprotected, LOVE being the 5th
dimension, contacting through black-hole by pushing the books! Oh my!
can anybody be more superficial about science? my advice to anybody who
has a critical mind: don't waist your time.

Though I am not a Bat-person, and do not wish to become one, I have
admired Christopher Nolan for his early films and 'Inception', though,
with the exception of 'Insomnia', I always regarded them as, in the
immortal words of Andrew Sarris 'less than meets the eye'. I do not
like to call films pretentious, but with 'Memento' and 'Inception' the
word certainly came to mind. They seemed shallow pretending to be deep.The same is, in my opinion, certainly true of 'Interstellar'. Yes, it
carries you along for a ride, and yes the special effects are great,
and yes, it might give us pause to think what will, in fact, be the
destiny of our species. But, my dear Mr Nolan, surely you must realise
that our species will not survive by planting American flags on distant
planets. And, like 'Gravity' before it, the search for a happy ending
has totally destroyed any shred of credibility of what might have gone
before. The image of Cooper floating around Saturn without his
spaceship, waiting to be picked up by a passing probe (just before his
oxygen runs out, of course) is so ridiculous that if Stanley Kubrick
were to be told that it is a respectful reference to the 'starchild' at
the end of '2001', he'd punch you in the nose. 'Interstellar' - for all of its attempts to incorporate relativistic
time dilation and very clever (I do not use that word in a derogatory
sense) visual representation of multi-dimensional string theory towards
the end, is void of any real cultural insight.The film simply extends 'The Wizard of Oz' into the space age and
decides at the end that there is really somewhere better than home. It
is TOSH! Great films tell us something memorable about the human
condition, or the nature of cinema itself. This film, for all its
quotes from Dylan Thomas does neither. It is for people who think that
the word 'awesome' has some profound meaning and not, as is the case,
an excuse for not finding a more appropriate and restrained reaction. Any suggestion that it deserves a Best Picture Oscar is a sad comment
on the way that those awards have become debased in recent years.

If you saw ""sunshine"" and thought ""wow, good thing they had scientist
advisers, this stuff is so plausible"", you will like ""interstellar"".If you saw ""armaggeddon"" and thought ""what an awesome movie, i just
wished they would have dragged the scene where he says goodbye to his
daughter out even more"", you will like ""interstellar"".If you saw ""inception"" and thought ""this movie would be so much better
in SPACE!"", you will like ""interstellar"".And if you liked ""2001"" or any other intelligent/geeky sci-fi movie,
you will hate ""interstellar"".Like some of Nolan's earlier works, it's long for the sake of length
only. Its plot is up there with ""armaggeddon"" in pure stupidity and
forced US-cowboy-patriot-macho-ism, its special effects are
underwhelming, its plot twists are obvious, its setting makes no sense,
its characters are flat and forgettable, and its constant citations of
""2001"" just serve to make you remember how much better Kubrick did all
of this with a tiny fraction of the money almost 50 years back.Disappointing.

Let me start by saying that I have enjoyed Christopher Nolan's work in
the past; Memento, Insomnia, (parts of) The Batman Trilogy. I find him
a very talented film-maker with strong ideas and visual sense.
Therefore it makes me very sad to state that, categorically, this is an
absolute turkey. In many places, the plot is so full of holes, that you
can do little but laugh-out loud. There will be reviewers on here,
talking about DEPTH, Intimations of Mortality etc etc. Forget it. This
is just a total misfire. Actors used to say, despairingly, that they
were playing Johnny Exposition - you know the guy who explains
everything to the audience. Note I said Despairingly. This has almost
every character explaining everything from wormholes to the Mystery of
Love (oh yeah). After a totally boring, drawn-out beginning which seems
to be there to prove that Nolan has watched The Grapes of Wrath many
times over, we get the first huge laugh when we meet Sir Michael Caine,
with a laughable Posh - Cockney - American accent. He is playing the
part that Sam Shephard (in this) or Morgan Freeman (usually) play. He
is not up to it; never was never will be. It takes a certain amount of
skill to be able to deliver line after line of pseudo-scientific
gobbledygook and make it sound real. Caine's performance - like so many
of his performances - screams out ""Where's my bleedin' paycheck?"" When
Coop (Gary Cooper - westerns - get it) agrees to fly this practically
suicidal mission to the outer reaches of space, he blasts off like a
Cosmic Cowboy, all bravado and charisma - at which point his fellow
crew member shows him - with a pen and paper - what a wormhole is. Yes,
when he is leading a flight into outer space, a little late doncha
think? It gets worse, when poor Anne Hathaway, playing, as my son said
- Science Girl, has to recite a monologue about Love and how it can
cross all dimensions of space, time, blah blah blah. I really felt for
her. I won't expand on the Plot, I couldn't if I wanted to. And the
last 30 minutes have to be seen to be disbelieved. This is NOT one of
those films that you see and forget immediately, you will wake up in a
few months time, laughing at Michael Caine's last scene or his recital
of Dylan Thomas' famous lines - not once but twice...and the End. Oh
the end. McConaghey gives it his all, having to cry on more than one
occasion - believe me, I know how he felt. Don't believe anyone if they
tell you 'you didn't GET it'. That's like saying you didn't GET an
episode of Two and a Half Men. Ambitious yes, but a turd is a turd -
even if they meant to produce a new hybrid Rose.

Mr. Cooper and his family live in fictional earth which is in mortal
peril. There is no way to save this poor earth, soon to be another
lifeless planet. Saving humanity might be an option. Just so happens to
be, Mr. Cooper is an old astronaut. He finds a secret NASA base via
binary numbers and gravity because that's how those work, and is sent
to the final mission which will decide the destiny of human kind, the
very next day!Mr. Cooper is a many-sided man. He has a family. Son and daughter. The
son won't matter though since this is a relationship drama written
around father and daughter. His daughter is young and very sad about
her father leaving to a nearly certain-dead mission. He might never
return. And there is that damn ghost in her room, too.Mr. Cooper goes to the space anyway, and leaves his daughter grieving.
This would have been a very short movie otherwise. By now, an hour of
precious screen time has been wasted to show us how daughter-father
relationships work. Mr. Cooper's adventure has finally reached the space and scifi phase
this movie was supposed to be all about. He travels thru wormholes with
the power of jet engines and pseudo science to save this damn old
species from extinction. There are 3 planets he needs to check out.Mr. Cooper goes to a water planet (more specifically water to the knee
level planet). There 1 hour equals 7 years in earth's time, but they
decide to try this most ducked up planet out of 3 planets first because
Nolan has to off write one of the grew members like right now and make
an imaginary timeskip to add backdrop. They also didn't have enough
fuel to go in all planets. Later on they do have enough fuel because
otherwise the story would have had a deadend. But who notices stuff
like this anyway! They also leave one guy to the spaceship to live in
earth's timeline because that is definitely awesome when he says how
long he waited for them. Mr. Cooper decided that water planet is a bit off and goes to the next
one.They find a living human there. But oh, this guy is evil and tried
to kill everyone and steal their spaceship. Now we have reached 2 hour
mark with epic tales and nice space stuff.Mr. Cooper goes to the final planet, but sends the woman there and does
a heroic sacrifice instead. He drifts in space, ready to die. But wait
a minute. Epic writing stuff happens and he drifts into an endless 5
dimensional loop where he is the ghost in her daughter's room! What an
epic. I call smart and well-though.Mr. 5 dimensional Cooper living in her daughter's bookshelf and her
adult daughter in the room reach an epic concluding thriller where she
just knows that her room a magical place and has to solve a puzzle. She
solves puzzle and everyone is saved including Mr. Cooper. Hurray hurray
hurray. Except the woman who Mr. Cooper ""saved"" hah, irony.

Previously having been a fan of a few of Nolan's films that actually
were the opposite of what this film is - masterpieces, I peeked at the
ratings here on IMDb. However had I scrolled further down to see where
they were coming from and what the reviews really were, I probably
would've discovered the truth and not have decided to take the
inevitable trip into this black hole with Nolan and suffer, something I
am extremely embarrassed about and will always be haunted for.
Unfortunately I cannot get the three hours of my life taken away by
this film. Do not watch this.At a great probability, an atrocious waste of money went into making
this because I couldn't help but question where it all went. It
probably went into a black hole. Common sense was extremely uncommon in
the entire film and to an extent that would actually anger you, making
you wonder how stupid the director thinks of you otherwise. Like plenty
others, I felt a necessary urge to be informant about this tragedy and
so created an IMDb account just to write this. Not surprisingly, I
found that a lot of others have already said most of what I wanted to
say about the film.I'm going to try to sum up some scenes, shortened to
the best of my ability that would give you an idea of how awful this
movie really was and how dreadful my time went sitting through it all
hoping to find a little substance somewhere down the line, being a
patient guy. On the real this movie is not even worth your 10 dollars
on a DVD rental. You'd probably sleep through all of it in any case.So I spend twenty dollars to go see this and upon the first ten minutes
I find myself looking back at my life wondering where I had gone wrong
to deserve this. To begin with, the start of this film with Mathew
McConaughey on some unknown farmland somewhere and who knows where,
does not create any picture or lead you anywhere for you to even
develop one on your own, to get a hold of whether an 'Interstellar'
will actually begin to unfold or whether not. Our lead, with his kids drives his truck off road down on to fields of
corn ( with a flat tire ) to follow what seems to be some ""Nasa test
drone/ robot plane"", as soon as he spots it randomly flying in the air.
So he drives with his kids for say over twenty minutes with the flat as
his car runs down heavy bushes of corn fields, where he commands his
kid son to ""take the wheel"" while he moves in the backseat now to turn
on his laptop through which he has decided to and even knows how to
track this drone! From this point on I tried hard to stay awake. He later just happens to stumble upon a Nasa base that also happens to
be only minutes away from where he lives. I steady awake to the part
where our hero gets out the car outside the Nasa base with blinding
lights in front of him. Next, he gets whacked by a robot, taken hostage
and then wakes up in front of Anne Hathaway, inside the base. Then
you've got Michael Caine telling him that he is ""the chosen one"" to fly
a rocket in spite of the fact that Matthew mistakenly discovered the
base. After exchanging a few words, our hero seems fit to be the pilot
of the rocket ship ( without real training ) for a mission everybody is
newly introduced to. What is this mission about? To go find another
planet that would sustain life because Earth is no longer going to be a
hospitable place in a few years although no one knows why. That is not
it. Guess where they're all going to look for one? In a black hole.
Forty minutes deep and you'll find that by now you'd rather walk out
because it doesn't really matter anymore how the film turns out. Later nearing the end, McConaughey's ship is about to run out of fuel
any minute where the ship explodes at full capacity leaving him to fall
into the black hole to find himself in a five dimensional wall space.
Here he communicates to Earth with the assistance of the robot that
should've been destroyed in that ship, to his daughter through a wrist
watch lying on her bedroom shelf at home and she happens to sense what
is exactly going on Wow this was just terrible. Now, to all those of you who have the slightest idea of what a black
hole is and what it does or doesn't do for that matter, do not waste
your time watching this even on DVD. In fact, make sure you do not
waste your hours even watching it for free on television shortly soon
because it would make you so sad, scared and bored all at the same time
like you couldn't believe.Not one minute of this film was ""possible"" if you like, even bit by
bit, to create any practical sense of what went on or even what could
have come out of it.This movie was so bad I came out paralyzed. To my horror, I'm left with
no words to describe the experience and I'm only trying.I consider myself pretty tough after having the courage to sit entirely
through and not walk out within the first twenty minutes like I should
have done.

This movie was so boring I literally had to leave the theater before I
fell asleep sitting upright. I gave Interstellar a full hour to get
more interesting, considering the rave reviews and ratings on this site
that prompted me to see it. But I couldn't wait any longer.The film was scientifically implausible to such an extent that I could
not suspend disbelief and enjoy the film at face value. The character
development was weak, the protagonist was arrogant and unlikable and
the acting talent of many great actors was utterly wasted on this bomb.
The dialog was predictable, unimaginative and flat. While it did not affect the quality of the film, I was disappointed
that the movie was based on the dangerous delusion that human beings
might be able to find a new home in space, so people don't have to
think too much about taking action on the very real climate change that
is destroying planet Earth right now. But it was the series of stupid moments in the first hour that informed
me Interstellar was not going to meet my standards for an intelligent
film. The first stupid moment was during the life-threatening giant
dust storm scene, complete with large chunks of flying debris. After
the family jumps into the truck and races home for shelter, the driver
inexplicably parks the truck about fifteen yards away from the front
door so that they all have to run outside through the dust storm before
reaching the house. Huh?Another stupid moment was when the protagonist is asked to pilot a
gargantuan state-of-the-art space craft (apparently built by a few
dozen people without any budget) less than an hour after he first
surprises NASA with his first arrival. This pilot has not flown an
aircraft for years and there is no way anyone, no matter how
experienced he once was, could fully master the technology of this ship
and be prepared for a complex space mission in the extremely short
period of time that elapsed (evidenced by no change in the age of the
pilot's children) between being asked to captain the ship and actually
doing so. He almost instantly assumes full command of the ship and the
crew and successfully takes the ship into deep outer space on a
dangerous mission. This sequence of events had no credibility. It felt
like some adolescent boy's fantasy come true.The last-straw final stupid moment was when I realized that the female
astronaut played by Anne Hathaway is wearing fresh make-up everyday
including false eyelashes. Not a big deal considering the major
problems with this film, but it nevertheless annoyed me. What competent
astronaut is going to waste time and energy applying false eyelashes in
outer space during a serious space mission? How would several years
worth of cosmetics (along with false eyelashes) even get approved as
cargo given the severe space limitations of a spaceship? How are we
supposed to find this astronaut credible?That's when I realized it really was time to abandon the film. I was
getting downright irritable.

it seems that most people write their very first review after seeing
the worst film of their lives, or after seeing the best. this is my
first, driven to review to give a more honest rating and review than a
9.1.if you want to learn about physics, watch a documentary. if you want to
be bored out of your mind for hours on end, then go and see
interstellar. lead character mumbles 80% of the time (i thought it was
just my hearing after being blasted with noise during the film at
first). the use of sound is clever the first time, brash and loud, then
deadly silent. but then it quickly becomes over used. scenes are so
long and drawn out, this seems like a film a director wanted to make
for his own viewing and ego. anne hathaway just looks tearful (you know
the scene in snow white when she wandering about the forest scared of
everything?) all of the time. I've never walked out of a film, and
sadly couldn't this time (i didn't want to disturb the sleeping people
around me you see...). if id been on an aisle seat, id have been gone
after an hour. its not that the film is 'too clever', its just utterly
boring.

Listen ""I'm not a smart man"", but I have basic reasoning skills and
common sense. Now whilst I understand that sci-fiction doesn't follow
the rules of reality (suspension of disbelief and all), there still has
to be coherency, rules, and order however fantastical within the made
up world so that people buy into the movie. This movie lacks those
attributes in spades and is a bitch slap to the viewer's intelligence.In one snippet of the three hour non-sense you'll endure and I do mean
endure, the intrepid saviors of the world decide to check out a water
planet because their predecessor sent a beacon that this was a viable
planet for new earth, but within minutes of their landing on two inches
of water they realize that a giant wave had smashed their scout to bits
promptly after she landed years before and they were about to suffer
the same fate... but oh happy day they manage to escape wasting only a
few hours of their time (but decades of earth time). Well that sucks
but it makes sense that they had to check it out right? Not when you
realize they could have avoided the watery planet from hell if the
first scout hadn't sent out a beacon saying the planet was viable in
the first place, after all how could she know that in the mere MINUTES
between when she landed and was then smashed to bits?!?! Nice to know
that when the fate of mankind is in the balance a responsible scientist
would jump to such a rushed conclusion, ""hey guys, I just landed here,
looks great, come now xoxo."" Then you have another scientist on another planet who was supposedly
selflessly brave enough to go on a one-way trip to scout a planet, then
chicken shi!s out when he gets there and realizes it's not viable and
he's a dead man so selfishly dooms mankind's one chance by having them
waste their limited resources to get there just to unwittingly rescue
him, but then decides he can still save mankind by killing his rescuers
so that he can complete the mission all by himself, holy whiplash with
his conflicting moralities/immoralities Batman.I could go on and on but I won't. I conclude by saying it really irks
me when a movie like this gets lauded as a masterpiece when it's really
just acid tripping rubbish.

What a huge pile of steaming poop! I could not believe that the movie
critics gave this horrible movie a 9.2 rating.The movie is slow as hell. The characters are so badly developed that
you never care for them. Good actors play characters that appear in the
movie juts to be disposed off soon after.The special effects are pretty weak. You see the spaceship vibrating
all the time but the faces of the actors are not reflecting the shaking
or the gravitational pulls. But, of course, they make lots of ugly
faces. You should see the movie Stealth to learn a thing or two about
this kind of special effects.The robot is the most ridiculous thing in the movie.The plot is just so far fetched that I caught myself smiling at times.Who let the writer into the cutting room?! 3 Hours! Are you serious?!
Only an unabashed Christopher Nolan fanboy would have the courage to
claim to have found any redeeming quality on this ""practical joke"".$200,000,000.00 US Dollars. What a waist!

My girlfriend and I decided to watch this movie at home as we missed it
when it was doing the rounds in our local cinema. How glad we were, for
at least it meant we were able to sip on our wine and chat in between -
which we would have not been able to do had we watched in the cinema.
And we did a LOT of chatting, mostly about the direness of the film
itself. I can't believe so many reviewers thought this film to be
amazing (but then we're all entitled to our opinions - and we all know
how opinions differ to the extremes at times). However, I honestly
couldn't connect with ANY of the characters in this film - particularly
the leads. I really have no words...just found the whole film totally
ridiculous - and don't even get me started on Hans Zimmer's background
music!!! We needed subtitles for some scenes as the music was so
overpowering we couldn't hear a word that was being said. I was even so
bored at one point that I started to imitate Matthew McConaughey's
irritating 'whistle' as he speaks. Enough said methinks.

This is the movie that proves what many people by now have already
realized: People are being payed to write 10 stars fake reviews! Let me
tell you this: This movie is really NOT that great!First, it's too long. It takes one hour just for the space mission to
start.It's slow paced and VERY sentimental, or, in other words, most of it is
boring.I'm not an English native speaker, but my English is not bad either. I
have no problems watching movies in English, and yet it was very hard
for me to understand the main character's mumbling in his farmer
accent. All other actors spoke properly, except him, the most important
one.The plot is not very logical: Planets just in front of a giant black
hole?! Yes, this must be the place to live everybody is dreaming of.Imagine your colleagues in the space station would say to you: ""OK,
we're now ready to fly down to that planet. You wait here. Don't worry,
we'll come back soon, in... some YEARS!"" You'd probably smile and say:
""Wonderful! OK, go now!"", right? One day they come back and are
probably surprised to see you haven't committed suicide because of
depression, even though you waited 23 years (!!!) for them. You must be
the most patience man in the entire Universe.And again a female ""scientist"" who looks like a model and behaves like
an amateur. An obligatory part of every sci-fi movie nowadays.This is just to give you an idea. There is much more, so read the other
negative reviews.Good night. And good luck.

AM I THE ONLY ONE ON PLANET EARTH WHO THINKS THAT THIS FILM IS ABSOLUTE
TOSH? Perhaps I'm being unkind because I could only handle an hour
before walking out. I thought the acting in particular was very poor.
The storyline is twaddle - a farmer with flight experience finds NASA
in an unspecified location with a rocket that is going to save Earth -
a typecast Michael Caine (thank goodness it wasn't Morgan Freeman)
opens the boardroom door and there is the rocket!. It seemed to me that
used actual rocket launch footage? The time element is misused and the
special effects are not that great. I thought Elysium knocked socks off
this film. I did semi enjoy the water sequence but it was at the point
where they get back to the mother ship that I walked ................
very quickly out of the cinema. Ps I love Matthew McConaughey in true
detective and I can't believe I was looking at the same actor

At over 2100 reviews at the time of this writing, I guess there's
nothing left to be said other than my opinion.I'd probably need a PhD in Physics from MIT to understand half of the
technological terms in the movie, but I still found it to be rather
awesome. After reading some of the reviews here, I think a lot of
people are taking this sci-fi fantasy tale way too seriously and
literally.Christopher Nolan's latest, which he co-wrote as well with his brother
Jonathan, at 2 hrs and 48 min in length, can be ridiculously absurd one
moment then quickly turn into riveting action the next.Matthew McConaughy and Anne Hathaway lead a long list of screen
notables here, too numerous to mention. I did want to mention that I
thought Mackenzie Foy, as Murph, the 10-year-old daughter of McConaughy
was terrific in her role.I thought the musical score here was excellent, the wit and humor of
the robot TARS (Bill Irwin) was on target. the special effects could be
rather hokey at times but then other times were amazing, and the movie
did contain a number of twists and turns which I liked.All in all, despite its' drawbacks I found this sci-fi fantasy to be a
rather awesome and epic ride.
"

A lot has been said and heard about this movie but none of it comes
even close to the experience of watching it. It has all the elements of
a Nolan movie and just like in all of his other movies he decides to go
a bit further. This time, he went a little too far. The story behind
the movie has it's flaws. There really is no explanation of what
happened/is happening. Instead you are given fragments in the first
half of the movie hoping one will put all the pieces together. All in
all, the first part seems a bit rushed and leaves you wondering if more
could have been told. But, since the real story is not why the travel
is necessary but the travel itself once the crew is off, the story
really kicks in. The main part of the movie gives a great ride, pumps
your blood with adrenaline from time to time and gets you emotional
pretty often. The problem I personally had was that the story taking
place simultaneously on Earth was less shown than I expected. A
different approach was expected but that did not stop Chastain from
giving the best role in the movie. The last part of the movie is
dynamic and filled with problems real people would have if found in a
situation like that. But the explanation given at the very end was a
bit to much for me. I heard that this was called ""the most
scientifically accurate movie"" and that physicist around the world
fought over the fact was that true or not. Nevertheless, way too much
theoretical physics in the end. Since I love SF movies I am willing to
look past the over- the-top science part, but what really got to me was
that it was predictable. From the very moment I saw a black hole in the
movie I put two and two together and that kinda ruined it for me a
little. Regarding the acting, as I said before, Chastain gave the most
powerful performance in the movie. She doesn't have much screen time,
but she sure knows how to use it. The two that actually lead the movie
- McConaughey and Hathaway were brilliant. McConaughey did a little
better job handling the emotions of a father with the responsibilities
of a team leader and the savior of mankind. His performance was
outstanding. Hathaway was good, decent, without a single word that can
be said against her, but for a movie like this, that is almost
completely on the shoulders of the actors, she should have done more.
The others did a good job, particularly Casey Affleck who's character
was a grand comparison to Chastain's. The music given it was done by
the mastermind Hans Zimmer was spectacular. Just the right notes, just
the right timing, just the right music. His understanding of what
movies should sound like is amazing. All in all, Interstellar is a
magnificent movie. It is a type of movie Nolan does best. It has all
the elements of being a classic like Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey,
it comes really close to being the new space odyssey, and it will not
perish with time. Still, this might be a bit too much for the average
moviegoer, a lot has to be digested here, it is not a simple or easy
movie to watch. But, if your braincells don't shut off and you don't
expect another Die Hard movie, you will appreciate this masterpiece.
"
20,3,"
Unfortunately the film didn't reach the high expectations I had for it!
I love sci-fi movies but Interstellar left me flat and disappointed.First the opening hour of the film was boring and ordinary and the
'Earth's problem' with the sand storms was somehow underplayed and
unmoving. I thought that maybe when they go in space things could get
better... well, they did for a while but then the crew landed on the
Ice covered planet and things got pretty sour.The idea of Cooper getting into the dimensional space and wrapping the
story with the beginning was good but then again the end was OK and
obviously left for a 2nd film.The sound was not good at all - I could barely hear and understand what
they were saying, so maybe 50% of the films sound was a high pitched
music overpowering the scenes.At the end I thought - this is a film for people who doesn't like sci-
fi movies, don't believe in life in other planets and are narrow minded
and believe only in conventional science. I suppose they got to watch
something like that and like it...I appreciate the effort of everybody involved in this creation but it's
not for me.
"
21,3,"
I was excited for this movie. I liked pretty much all of Nolan's
previous movies and I love sci-fi. Judging from the reviews, I was
expecting something similar to the quality and entertainment of
Inception. What I got was probably one of the most boring movies I've
seen on cinema.The movie is unnecessary long, the dialogs are predictable and make you
laugh, and the subject of the movie (which btw is not interstellar
traveling) has been done several time before (awfully usually). We get
it. Family is important, love is valuable. This is not a sci-fi movie,
this is his is a family movie about a father's love for his children.I will not go into details to avoid spoilers, but there were about 10
minutes after the first slow hour that got me excited for the rest of
the movie, but it was only a break and we were back to boredom and more
crying by McConaughey. I found the acting pretty bad, which I guess is
a result of the awful script, since I liked McConaughey's acting on
Dallas Buyers Club (and partially on true detective).
"
22,1,"
This is yet another movie that relies on a soaring soundtrack and
pretty visuals to distract you from the fact that it is poorly crafted,
with massive plot holes, manipulative story lines that go nowhere and
inconsistent, poorly developed characters.It gives us a bunch of garbled scientific babble without explaining
what's going on - I guess we are just expected to accept it, even
though it makes no sense. If we are to believe ""Coop"" is desperately
needed for this mission to save the planet, why is this former engineer
and magnificent pilot not working for NASA? Why is he sent to
""discover"" their compound through his daughter, who displays very
little sign of brilliance, besides being a handful at school and
understanding morse code. We are given the vague notion that sandstorms choke everything but corn
for some reason, and even that apparently hardy crop will die off soon
- the good people at NASA have one guy working on it, choosing instead
to concentrate the planet's most brilliant minds on mastering the
galaxy and transporting the race to a brand new planet, conveniently
through a wormhole.""Coop"" is apparently brilliant enough to be the only guy who can save
the world, yet he needs tje concept of a wormhole explained to him by
having another guy poke a hole in a piece of paper - eureka! The whole movie takes place on a shifting foundation of science! No,
love! No, supernatural phenomena! And when ""Coop"" is able to find the magic library and use amazing
technology to communicate in the wormhole with no means of life
support, he uses that amazing technology to send his brilliant daughter
a message in morse code. If you're advanced enough to have an AI robot
helper that functions inside a wormhole, surely that technology can be
more believably deployed to save the world than with a father's
supernatural love manifesting in a short message of complicated science
delivered through a watch.And at the end, after ""Coop's"" long, improbable, emotional journey to
get back to his beloved daughter, he stays with her for all of 30
seconds, not bothering to meet his descendants or inquire about the
fate of his son, whom he kind of liked too, I guess. And then he flies
off to be with his love Anne Hathaway, even though they showed no
apparent signs of romantic connection, and who has apparently been
abandoned on a planet by herself, even though the technology existed to
rescue her.If only the viewer could master time/space travel to get back nearly
three hours of wasted viewing time.
"
23,1,"
1. Far far too long. Nearly 3 hours? 2. 50% of McConnaughey's dialogue totally incomprehensible. He hardly
moves his lips so what he says comes out as a hoarse whisper. Didn't
have that problem listening to Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway or Matt
Damon.3. Characters doing random things that had no logic. Why did Matt Damon
suddenly attack Cooper?4. That annoying thing where actors suddenly start explaining the plot.
""We're approaching a wormhole. So, tell me all about wormholes"". ""Ok,
this is how it goes....""5. Mostly, the film was just boring. Lots of films last around the 3
hour mark and you need to have something to keep the audience's
interest going. My interest lapsed around the halfway mark.
"
24,1,"
** MINOR SPOILER **I was really looking forward to this film. I like movies and I like
science fiction. I like most of Christopher Nolan's films. And I think
Matthew McConaughey has done some great acting work (True Detective for
example). So the film seemed to have all the ingredients that would
make it enjoyable.Sadly though I found it to be a disappointment. I think there are three
reasons for this.First, and foremost, I did not make any emotional connection with the
characters. Matthew was supposed to be the hero and protagonist of the
film but I didn't connect to him at all. Other characters e.g. the
daughter, the grown up son, the Matt Damon character I found
irritating. Regardless of the subject matter of a film I need to
emotionally connect with the characters in some way.Secondly, there were too many basic plot points that made no (common)
sense (I'm not talking about the science not making ""science sense"" as
that's accepted and okay in a science fiction film). *** SPOILER NEXT**
For example Matthew McConaughey turns up at the NASA base and without
any credible explanation is told he'll be the pilot of the space
ship?**SPOILER ENDS**Thirdly, I think in attempt to make a serious weighty science fiction
film with gravitas, the entire tone of the film became too
unremittingly serious...and they omitted to lighten the mood
occasionally with a bit of appropriate humour. Take as a comparison The
Shawshank Redemption (which currently tops IMDb's greatest movie poll).
A great film with gravitas and a serious message, often emotionally
dark and harrowing at times..but it uses humour appropriately to
balance the tone of the overall film.So very sadly a real disappointment I'm afraid...and I find myself
genuinely puzzled why this film has got such a high IMDb rating.....in
exactly the same way (and same reasons) that I was puzzled by the high
rating for Skyfall.
"
25,1,"
I may drop a few spoilers here, so be warned. I find it very hard to
understand why so many people thought this movie was so good. Yes,
there was a good cast. Yes, the special effects were good (in this day
and age that is expected.) But the story? Teaching that space travel to
the Moon was a hoax? What's that about? The farmer just happens to be a
trained astronaut? His daughter just happens to be a mathematical
genius? The lies that are told, and this intelligent astronaut is so
gullible? The denigration of education, as if that is any positive way
to save mankind? The striving by the government to have more farmers,
when it has been obvious since the industrial revolution that larger
mechanized farms utilizing fewer farmers are more productive. The
belief that new colonies can be created by bringing embryos to life?
Who thought this up? The same people who strive for an uneducated
populace? And amid all this, somehow commuter space travel is
developed? Too much Bull for me to swallow! Really folks?????
"
26,10,"
Wowser! This Christopher Nolan film was presaged with such marketing
hype that I went in with pretty low and cynical expectations. But I was
frankly blown away with it.Just about everyone raves about Christopher Nolan's work, and you look
back at his Filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume:
from Memento via the (rather over-hyped imho) Dark Knight Batman
series-reboot through to Inception, one of my favourite films of all
time. For me, Interstellar is right up there with Inception for
thought-provoking, visually spectacular and truly epic cinema.We start in familiar 'Day after Tomorrow"" territory, with mankind
having in some way  not entirely explained  messed up the planet. As
I understood it (and the film probably does require multiple watches
with  see comments below  subtitles=on) the rather clever premise is
that the world's food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a
vindictive 'blight'. This delivers the double whammy of destroying
mankind's provisions but also, by massive reproduction of the organism,
progressively depleting the Earth's oxygen. For some reason  again,
which I didn't get on first viewing  this is accompanied by massive
dust storms. It is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid-West
population first: starvation, lung disease or suffocation. Matthew
McConnaughey plays the widowed Cooper, an ex-NASA drop out turned
farmer given the opportunity by mission-leader Professor Brand (an
excellent Michael Caine) to pilot a NASA mission. The goal is to punch
through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect, through
previous work, that a new home for mankind could be found.The first part of the film is set on and around Cooper's farm, setting
in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film: that
Cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his
elderly father (John Lithgow, again superb) and young children Murph
(aged 10) and Tom (aged 15) whilst recognising that danger for him
comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of
relativity that could change everything, time-wise, for when he
returns.Cooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including
Brand's daughter played by a love-struck Anne Hathaway, who again shows
she can act.To say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental
discovery. (However, I would add that it is good to see that the
character that plays my namesake Dr Mann (in a surprise cameo) is
equally good looking! LOL).In terms of plus points, where do I start? The visuals are utterly
stunning. Whilst reminiscent in places of Kubrick's ""stargate"" from
2001, the similarity is only passing. The film adds a majesty and scale
to space that surpasses wonder. Elsewhere there are some interesting
visual effects: this might have just been me of course, but after the
dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the
first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous.Equally stunning is Hans Zimmer's score which is epic and (in places)
very VERY loud. The film certainly doesn't ""go quietly into the night""!
When matching the noise of the score/choir to the sound effects in the
launch sequence the combination is ear-bleedingly effective. This must
be a strong contender for the soundtrack Oscar for 2014. One quibble,
again 2001 related, is that Zimmer uses the last chord of Also Sprach
Zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes Richard
Strauss's estate receives some royalties! The acting is top notch: I've
already mentioned Caine and Lithgow, but McConnaughey, Hathaway and
Jessica Chastain are all great. A particular shout-out should go to
Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph, who is magnetically charismatic and
just brilliant in the role.Above all, Nolan's direction is exquisite. The film has a slow build on
earth (which adds to the lengthy running time) but defines the
characters and primes the plot perfectly. And some of the editing cuts
 again, Cooper's farm departure/launch sequence overlay is a great
example  are superb in building the mood and the tension.I've decided that I am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star
film is a rarity indeed. Where I could have knocked off a star was in
some of the dialogue on the soundtrack, which was pretty inaudible in
places: McConnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong
southern accent is indecipherable in places. I look forward to the DVD
subtitles. And one of the character's dying words  delivering a key
plot point in the film  was completely lost to me (but thankfully
later restated). Whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious, the end
of the film, playing fast and loose with physics I fear, requires a
gravity-defying suspension of belief (although I guess the same could
equally be said of 2001: A Space Odyssey).However, the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours I
will make a rare exception to my rating 'rule'. Overall, this is a
top-notch Sci-Fi film. And a final word: PEOPLE THIS IS A MUST SEE ON
THE BIG SCREEN! (If you enjoyed this review, please see my archive of

OK, here it goes. This is my first review in nearly three years. I
thought I should start with this movie. I will try to be as simple as
possible and somewhat comprehensible.The film begins well, calm and above all with the typical images of
Christopher Nolan. I think you will understand what I mean if you
followed his work. The general idea presented to us is what you already
know, the planet earth is dying because it no longer produces food and
there is occasionally some scenes a la ""The Mummy"" in a giant cloud of
dust appearing around town . Right now they only eat corn. In all this
we get to know the main character, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who
gives all of himself in this film, we noticed quite a committed
dedication to this role. And we also get to know his family, and the
family member we get to know deeper is his daughter, Murph (Mackenzie
Foy / Jessica Chastain).The idea of the film is basically a space odyssey in search of
salvation for the human race, but in my view, what I felt (and it was a
lot of feelings) is that this film was the idea of interpersonal (Is
that how is said?) salvation. Why? Throughout the film many topics are
covered: wormholes, black holes, theory of relativity etc. And add that
they were very interesting, but what was more interesting was the
father-daughter relationship that we see unfolding throughout the film,
which is what really moves Cooper to participate in this space
adventure, the idea to be able to save his daughter (and obviously the
rest of the family and humanity, but you understand me), and most other
relationships, not just human. Robots, especially the TARS were lovely.
Gave a little comedy to the seriousness of the story, and it was quite
rewarding to have these little moments of relaxation.In summary, in order to finish it, this movie is fantastic. I admit
that is one of the best films I've ever had the pleasure of seeing, is
one of the most ambitious exercises of Nolan and we see it the
beginning to the end. That is why I assign the maximum score of 10, and
a note to everyone to see it.PS: I'm sorry if my English is not the best, I will have to use the not
native language card here.

It's almost as if those who made this movie wanted to use two and a
half hours of less than stellar movie making (if you'll pardon the pun)
just so that the viewer could tough it out to the end and see a
ridiculously sentimental ending. Really, by the time the end finally
came, I found myself wondering what the point of the whole thing was. Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) is a farmer in the midwest
United States struggling along with his family to survive in some
future world in which humanity is facing extinction. The atmosphere is
changing so that there's less and less oxygen, and it's becoming harder
and harder to grow crops. In this part of the world at least everyone
seems to survive on a diet of corn, corn and more corn while being
constantly threatened by horrible dust storms. I'm assuming this is
meant to portray an environmental catastrophe. Eventually, Cooper and
his daughter Murph (played as a young girl by Mackenzie Foy, who did
well in the part) become aware that they're receiving some strange
signal and they head out to investigate - an investigation that
eventually leads to Cooper leaving Murph and the rest of his family
behind to explore space in the hopes of finding a new home for
humanity.I get it. I just didn't get excited by it. And I struggled from the
start (well, once Cooper was picked for the mission anyway) with the
question of why Cooper wasn't simply recruited for the mission from the
beginning. He's clearly the best pilot around - which Professor Brand
(Michael Caine) states openly - and he was immediately put in command
of the mission, which made me wonder why they were just going to leave
him playing farmer if he was really that good! That bugged me all the
way through. But what bugged me more was that there was no consistency
to this. There didn't seem to be any real direction to it; it didn't
seem to be leading anywhere. I thought the storyline involving Mann
(Matt Damon) was extraneous and just added time to the movie without
adding much in the way of substance. There are a few places where it
seemed as if the movie was trying to pay tribute in some way to ""2001"":
particularly around the character of the robot TARS, and even some of
the special effects/cinematography, but as I said it just didn't seem
to be leading anywhere, and I wasn't entirely certain if this mission
had accomplished much of anything.The entire movie seemed to be little more than a vehicle getting us to
the sentimental ending. Murph had been angry that her father had left
her behind, but she remembered that he promised he'd see her again, but
because of differences in the way time would pass for the two of them
(see: the theory of general relativity) she might be the same age as
him by the time that happened. As it turned out, Murph was an old lady
by the time Cooper returned to earth, and we get the sight of Cooper
visiting his daughter in the hospital on her deathbed. Sentimental,
yes, but I'm not sure it made the long wait to get there worthwhile.

Nolan is shooting, photographically, some of the best shots in his
career. It looks beautiful, not only the sequences in space but also
the scenes back on Earth. In terms of sound and vision, it is gorgeous
to look in. However once one goes deeper, things begin to slide.
Performance is lacklustre, characters do not seem fully developed nor
did I have time to invest interest in them. The narrative is
exposition-heavy and will most likely lose you in regards to interest
and logic after the forty minute mark. This is a deeply unsatisfying
film, boring, nonsensical, and wannabe-pretentious (despite Nolan's
fan-base being some of the more lowbrow members of the fan community.)

As this movie begins we are asked to contemplate a world in which
today's dire warnings of food shortage and unsustainability are proved
to be correct. This is a gripping and sobering premise for setting up a
post-apocalyptic scenario and engaged me for a while.With hindsight, even at this early stage there were hints of the
nonsense that was to follow. The high-speed chase, where a pick-up with
a blown-out tire somehow manages to drive at top speed through
cornfields without suffering any further damage, while Pop ensnares a
semi-autonomous drone with his Dell laptop, is but the most glaring
example.As the movie wore on, it became increasingly confused and nonsensical.
Getting to Saturn was vaguely within the realm of the credible. The
description of why the wormhole was spherical was pure comic genius.
The 2-D representation whipped up by our friend has a round hole, we
are told, so the 3-D version must be spherical. But what if he had used
a pen with a square cross-section to make his point? Would the wormhole
have been cuboid?Once they passed the wormhole, most principles of long-distance space
travel seemed to be forgotten. The ability to hop from planet to
planet, for some reason able to magically take off and leave orbit
without the Saturn-V style craft or anti- gravity equations that would
be required on earth, was nonsense. The plausibility of a habitable
planet so close to a black hole seems dubious to me. And the final
quasi-spooky drivel inside the black hole where some future humanity
had gone to all that effort just to provide our hero with a totally
lame-ass way of communicating... just sheer rubbish.It could have been so much better.

STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning
** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the future, Earth has become a pretty sad, desolate place, where
resources have run scarce and machines have taken over much. A space
time continuum in outer space is discovered, around the planet of
Saturn, that humanity can ascend to in order to begin a new life away
from the rapidly diminishing Earth. Cooper (a continually,
frustratingly mumbling Matthew McConaughey) a simple farmer, is chosen
to man the space craft that will save Earth, along with co pilots
Romilly (David Gyasi) and Brand (Anne Hathaway) and a talking robot
thing that looks like a fridge, by the name of TARS (Bill Irwin.) But
as the mission unfolds, they discover secrets and lies that threaten to
plunge them into conflict amongst each other, I guess. They're possibly
meant to do something else, and something else happens, but by the end
(which, given the length, I'm surprised I stuck around till), the whole
film had just so gone over my head I might have missed it.At the start of the new century, a young, promising director called
Christopher Nolan emerged, an eager and hungry young mind that
delivered Memento, an intelligent and original thriller that took a far
flung concept and played with your mind and demanded your full
attention to the end. He followed this with Insomnia, not only one of
my all time favourite thrillers, but also one of my favourite films,
that I still love to this day. After these two relatively independent
offerings, he established himself as one of the top new names, and
possibly Hollywood was happy to throw a lot of cash at him, and let him
run wild and indulge his darkest, most inner most relentless cerebral
musings, and from here on in, he went and delivered increasingly
lengthy productions that bombarded the minds of his audience with so
much anomaly and detail, even turning Batman into a challenging and
complex ride three times. Even his comparatively short 2006 effort The
Prestige seemed lost in it's own mystery and aggrandisement. But with
Interstellar, he's just completely surpassed himself.Clocking up at nearly three hours, the film, in the time you spend with
it (and you really do have to make quite a commitment) truly rakes up
every last second of it's stated running time, and that would mean
there's a lot to be taken in, and much you might have to describe and
re-live about it afterwards. It could be quite difficult, but actually
you can sum the film Interstellar up with one word: over. It's over
ambitious, over indulgent, over bloody long!, over bearing, over
cerebral over complicated and, just over whelming. And by the end,
after grudging with it for so long, you'll be glad it's 'over.'
Seriously, if you manage to get through it with out getting up to
stretch your legs at least once while it's still on, you should get a
telegram from the queen! I can't believe it took me so long to see it,
but I'm certainly glad I missed it in the cinema.An intelligent concept is fine, but it can't give the audience no room
to breathe like this. It's a shame, because if Nolan had delivered
something a little more condensed, the intricate plot the film had to
explore and any intelligent message it had to deliver could have been
better absorbed by the viewer, instead of being lost in a sea of
bafflement. Sadly, the best praise I can end up giving it is some
fabulous cinematography, in space and at sea that sticks in the mind.Inception was too much, really, but I took it as the most intellectual
film ever made and kind of have a soft spot for it, but this is just
too much. Nolan can be thankful his films haven['t lost their spark and
edge like fellow contemporary M Night Shyamalan, but he really needs to
stop being so ruthlessly anti-mainstream and pelting his audience with
such lengthy, cerebral exposition, or he might lose them forever. And
stop least stop making them so dour and humourless to boot. In terms of
a modern, space bound adventure, it goes without saying Alfonso
Couran's much trimmer Gravity does a better job of being smart and in
orbit. **

If you ever saw Kubrick's 2001 then do not waste your time in this
movie. If you did not;then rent or buy 2001 and avoid this piece of
crap.""INTERSTELLAR"" is a dumb and lazy written cash cow disguised as a
philosophical statement. ""INCEPTION"" was the same thing (but less
stupid and more entertaining or at least had more action and violence ) Do not be fooled by the concept; there are just one or two interested
statements in this movie but taking three hours for that is excessive.The whole things must make sense in Nolan's depressing mind; the world
is ending but people is still selfish enough to make matters worse. The
movie has zero humor and the positive or hopeful message is as fake as
the special effects.In fact; this is a movie about God; but Nolan's refuse to even refer
about religion; so the movie is about ""something"" that is never clear
and makes absolutely no sense. ***SPOILER AHEAD*** Without saying too
much about the first ending (there is a second happy ending to ensure
better box office receipts and is even more absurd ) why whoever could
create such a device just pass the message and solve the problem ?.
***END OF SPOILER***McConaughey is talk is almost incomprehensible. Anne Hathaway is always
good; but his character is under written. Jessica Chastain has to deal
a completely absurd and unbelievable and over dramatized situations
(and she does not succeed).In brief; do not commit the same error I made. Save your money for a
better and more sincere money; this one is just a scam.

I'm disappointed. Nolan failed to break out of his mold and make a
truly challenging movie. This is one heck of a summer pop corn movie,
I'll give it that. But it's not much more than that, and it has perhaps
the worst sound design I've heard in 20 years. Nolan himself says in
interviews that this is what he wanted -- really loud with dialog
that's hard to hear. To make it ""more immersive"" apparently. But if I
want immersive, I can go ride my pick of rides at an amusement park.
What I want when I go to the theater is for the director to tell a
story. And his crappy sound design gets in the way of his telling of
his story. And the story is yet another variation on his favorite theme
of recursion. Meh. Getting old Chris. Old. And by the end of the movie,
so were the endless references to 2001. Sheesh.A good amusement park ride, yes it is. But it's still considerably
below the bar set by Gravity last year.

The production values are A+ but the writing is that of a class B
picture. Filled with ridiculous, spacious claims and assumptions. The
premise itself is the weakest link, but then there is a ton of little
mistakes like driving through a sandstorm or placement of the
conference room, that can really strain ones suspension of disbelief.
It's akin to presenting Cinderella as a re-imagining of what life was
like in medieval times.what was amazing was that there was no sound in space scenes (other
than music) e.g. on thrusters. Usually I would appreciate that but it
was doubly distracting as they seem to have left a few dozen more
obvious, glaring oversights in.Then there is the horrendous acting by Anne Hathaway, and Jessica
Chastain to a lesser extent. Those two ladies make Matthew McConaughey
look like Alec Guinness. And McConaughey, with his annoying way of
speech, like he's got his mouth full of peanut butter or some other
brown substance, playing what has got to be one of the dumbest
smart-guys in film history. In all fairness, they were probably going
for tough but sensitive and smart just got lost in the cracks.It gets better as they get to the wormhole and some of the scenes
located outside of earth are entertaining, it does not however save the
viewer from a fate worse than Contact.
"
35,1,"
This movie takes the cake alongside The Maxtrix (1999) as the most
overrated movies of all time.Interstellar marks Christopher Nolans sense of self significance at an
unhealthy level, where to begin about how bad this movie is?.Characters: Terrible, i did not feel any real emotion towards anyone
but the little girl, was it Murph? catwoman completely ruined the whole
experience for me personally; that whole scene about love being the 5th
dimension had me reaching for a sick bag and oh lawdy i better not
forget Mutt Da'man who is cleverly and subtly given the last name Mann,
once again a complete turn off for the whole experience; mind you i
really enjoy the Bourne movies. Micheal Caine is above adequate as
always at playing the wise, sage role. The lead character was not
impressive even slightly; cant really find anything to point at in
terms of the acting, it was good.Sound: It seems we are all experienced and have numerous credentials
when it comes to critiquing orchestral pieces judging from the
countless reviews from people who say the score is a ""masterpiece"";
""time"" from Inception was truly great but the loud and extravagant
nature of it all is getting pretty tiresome and dull and i think Hans
Zimmer is taking a bit of an ego trip as well. Who's absolutely
retarded idea was it to have the background music louder than the
dialogue in some scenes? The only thing that achieved was making my
eardrums ache. The soundtrack is getting pretty diluted now and it all
just seems like its their to boost the in reality shallowness of the
movie, kinda like shouting in an argument.Plot and story: Completely and utterly stoopid yes ""stoopid"" to
emphasise just how mind numbingly horrible it was, get this the story
is advanced because the characters left a window open on the top floor
which results in dust falling onto some magnetic filings which reveal
the location of a secret NASA facility, if you seriously cant see how
bad this is you really don't have a brain or just don't use it. For a
race that can slingshot shuttles using planets gravitational fields and
travel through wormholes the cryo- chambers look like bloody tiled
baths, where is the sleek and futuristic design, Alien a movie made 35
years before Interstellar has better looking cryo-tubes who even
overlooked this? and don't even get me started on how the cryo-tubes
are essentially freezing time when one of the key messages in the movie
is that you can't stop time or travel backwards -_-. Black holes the
enigmatic and infinite object that alludes all the top scientist today
and which completely renders our knowledge of the current universe
seemingly pointless is just a library made out of strings which you
pluck to interact with the 3rd dimension; i think the facepalm i did
due to this idea has left a permanent mark on my face but wait what is
that you say ""light can't escape the pull of a black hole"" oh no its
fine im just gonna use my radio transmission technology to contact
someone from outside a black hole, screw you Einstein! The robots, how
could i overlook the robots, if that's how robots look in the future i
will commit a horrible act upon myself, i bet you everything i own it
was the same dude who designed the cryo- chambers.To those who compare this movie to Stanley Kubricks 2001 i am not even
going to acknowledge your existence, this movie is a joke, a
pretentious self indulgent movie which does nothing but throw heaps of
concepts and confusing ideas to make the audience think they are daft
and that the movie is of such a high intellectual level that they must
praise it. I don't usually give 1/10 but I gave this movie a 1/10 to hopefully
have even a minute impact on the overall score, its a loss for humanity
that this movie is even in the top 250 on IMDb but if the extent of
your movie going is to see the next transformers movie im pretty sure
you'll find this movie quite intelligent and ""awesome"" and ""the best
movie eva"".

omg this movie was so stupid, like really, waist of time,i even pulled
out my cell phone and browsed fb while it was playing because of how
stupid this movie was. The music at some parts was just so way over
kill, too loud and too way dramatic. The whole story was crap and did
not make any logical sense, so ur telling us that NASA did not know
that the best pilot to fly the space ship was living only about a car
drive away from ur secret hiding base? u did build a space ship to fly
out but cant have mri machines anymore? a drone was flying for 10 years
and no one saw it or knew about it? wtf, its like the person who wrote
this movie was like thinking we are all so stupid and wont understand
who this movie is not making any seance. OK the only part i did like
about the movie was when they found the bad guy who try to kill the
main character, that was something interesting, and his trying to dock
into the space station, it was nice story but still none nonsensical.
bc with time, it just don't make any sense, so they 2 walk away from
the space ship and then when he called the space ship to rescue him u
can see they fly so far, no way they could of walk that distance, then
at the same time they rescue the good guy via plane, the bad guy can
walk all the way back to another plane? while a 3rd one get blown
up???wtf and also how many shipped did they send anyways, it just did
not make any sense to me this movie. its just way too stupid. sorry,
but it was.i want my money back!
"
37,5,"
I'm really sorry. I so much wanted to like this film. So much has gone
into it and the concept is good, but it just didn't work for me. I found this to be a compact and fanciful story stretched up to
intergalactically implausible proportions. It didn't ring true, and it
was full of Hollywood formulae, like clumsy cliffhangers. And why did
we have to have a Western-style fight scene on an icy planet on the
other side of a black hole? There were no punches thrown in 2001.People will say it was too long but it wouldn't be any better if it was
shorter. It is also an unremittingly dark and depressing film except
for certain aspects. The brilliant special effects, loud sound track
and music served to mask the shortcomings. On the plus side it is thought-provoking about space and physics, the
actors gave everything, especially the main character, he was brilliant
- it didn't have George Clooney in it a big plus. The concept is
excellent, and it dramatises aspects of Einstein's theory of relativity
such as meeting your children who have grown older than you.I hope a lot of people like it, as I wouldn't want all that effort and
commitment to go to waste, so just ignore my opinion! Go and watch it
and make up your own mind!
"

As directed by Christopher Nolan, he of the pretentious, derivative,
mind-bending crap-fest that was Inception and the vastly over-rated
Dark Knight trilogy, I fully expected Interstellar to have plot holes
you could pilot a space station throughand, with a whopping running
time of 169 minutes, I figured staying awake would be a task almost as
gargantuan as the film's black hole (which is actually called
Gargantuathat's just how gargantuan it is!!!).Sure enough, the preposterous pseudo-scientific plot can be picked
apart with ease, but the film itself is something of an anomaly:
although it is a grossly indulgent pile of pretentious hooey that
stretches plausibility to breaking point, I found myself entertained
throughout. Interstellar is so far up itself that it actually
transcends all the laws of cinema and proves to be a rather enjoyable
piece of big-budget baloney as a result.For starters, we get Matthew McConaughey's farmer Cooper, who is chosen
to pilot NASA's only spacecraft, despite having spent the last decade
or so growing corn. Then we get two of science-fiction's most
aesthetically awkward robots in the form of A.I. units TARS and CASE.
After flying through a worm-hole, Cooper lands his spacecraft in
several inches of water and then surfs a massive tidal wave. We see a
planet so cold that its clouds are solid ice. We have a mad scientist
who rants about the human instinct for survival while head butting
Cooper with his space helmet. Although Michael Caine's character spans
23 years, he doesn't look a day older than when we first see him (his
voice just gets a bit hoarse, but not Batman hoarse). And Cooper enters
a black hole where he ends up behind a 5-dimensional bookcase that
allows him to manipulate gravity to send a message to his daughter via
wristwatch!!!And that's just the stuff I can recall right now (it's waaay past my
bed-time and I'm very tired).If only there had been a few ninjas, some gratuitous female nudity
(perhaps a race of insatiable, sexy alien maidens with over-sized
breasts), a planet of space zombies, and a laser battle, this would
have been the perfect so-bad-it's-good movie.7/10: it's too wonderfully silly for me too hate on it as much as I
really should.
"
39,1,"
I went to this film and all I can say is it was the longest technical
demonstration of bullshit i have ever seen. I'm having a hard time
writing about this film because I honestly wish I could forget about
the film.The film has its strong points and those are visually appealing
cinematography and an impressive use of sound. The negatives of this
movie are however to many to put in a single review. The film has an
alright beginning and the build up of the characters is done pretty
well and you get to see Matthew McConaughey do some wonderful acting.
However none of the characters were developed enough for you to care
for them. However the movie jumped around so much from plot to plot
that your emotions got shocked when very predictably a character gets
killed but then the story moves right along with a nice action scene
thrown in to keep you awake.The movie is full of quantum physics Jargon that no one could possibly
follow. The jargon is about an hour of the movie and I have a fairly
basic grasp on physics having taken a few college physics courses but I
can say for a fact that many of the things might be true out of context
but in the frame of the movie didn't make any sense I'm not writing
anymore in this review i just recommend you go see another film. It
felt like a waste of a good night to me but judging by the reactions of
all the people in my theater you will probably find it a confusing a
deep trip into breath taking quantum physics induced acid trip.
"
40,10,"
OK, I've just seen Interstellar and I can tell it's one of those movies
that you either love or hate.Personally I loved it and probably I'm going to watch it again to
process it a little bit more. It's not a simple movie, maybe that was
already clear, is a Nolan's film.Matthew McConaughey does a great job by portraying Cooper. The most
touching scenes are those between his character and Mackenzie Foy, who
plays the younger version of Murph, Jessica Chastain character. Either
it seems to be an ""Outer Space Film"" is more about human relations and
how important is for us to be linked with others. Even it's a long movie, 169 minutes, I didn't felt it that long or
tedious. The director managed to keep us engaged through the whole
film. The experience on IMAX in 70mm film. The image quality perceived was
superb, now I get why Christopher Nolan and other directors are
fighting to keep film alive. I had the opportunity to watch it at the Chinese theatre and was a
great experience, my first time in that theatre. The staff from the
theatre even told us that Nolan himself watched several scenes of the
movie in that theatre to ""calibrate"" the experience. Which is very
cool. Well, I encourage you to go and watch Interstellar to see of you love
or hate it.
"
41,1,"
Yaaaaaaawwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnn for nearly 3 hours.I put this on in the background and found lot's of other interesting
things to do. (Call my daughter), tidy up my emails, cut my nails,
Facebook. After a lot of fast forwarding, I gave up 90 minutes into it.Chasing a drone that is nothing like a drone and taking control of it
(like that was realistic) what looks like an Atlas rocket on the
outside is extremely spacious on the inside. Robbie the robot is made
of boxes covered in mirrored fablon (look up seventies material for
reviving old furniture). This film is disappointing in every aspect.
Unrealistic, poor visualisations, drawn out subject, don't waste 3
hours of your valuable time on it. I've taken 15 minutes out of mine to
save you.
"
42,6,"
Interesting set up introduces us to a disintegrating near-future world.
There's an intriguing reference to re-writing history, along the lines
of Capricorn 1, where planetary exploration is faked in a film studio.
McConaughey is the astronaut turned farmer who takes a circuitous, and
somewhat unlikely, route back to being a rocket man. Interstellar tries
to get the science right but quantum physics doesn't make for the best
dialogue. Neither are helped by dropping the spoken track way down in
the sound mix. McConaughey's tendency to speak through gritted teeth
doesn't help either. Although it looks great and is often very
imaginative, the film takes too much time exploring dead ends and
detours. At times, it felt a bit like a very long trailer for a very
epic series. And it really does seem very long, without ever settling
on a unified theme. The time anomaly aspects were good, but too much
time was spent getting there.
"
43,1,"
Without a doubt this is the worst movie that i have seen in my entire
life. Non- existent story, terrible acting, bad direction and a
convoluted and meandering plot leads to a deep sense of despair as the
movie came to its utterly meaningless conclusion. The garbled
scientific content and the many errors that run through the movie are
testament to the fact that a juxtaposition of science and Hollywood
simply does not work. Science represents the greatest achievement of
the human mind while movies by and large pander to the lowest and
basest instincts of the human race and actors by definition represent
falsehood and meaningless pretense.
"
44,4,"
I would agree with the haters on this movie. I love Rustin Cohle and
Matt Damon but this movie is a waste of time. God, I hate it so much.
It is stupid and shallow. Rustin Cohle and Jason Bourne in the same
movie yet they are given stupid lines to say. What an absolute bad
movie. Movies like this are really a horrible warning of the horrible
and terrible times we live in where insane nonsense rubbish like that
is considered quality. What is wrong with Christopher Nolan? Memento is
a great movie. The first Batman pretty cool (best Batman movie)
although a bit shallow perhaps (vague existentialism like ""my actions
define me""). Other Batman movies not very good. Inception interesting
but ultimately failing and Interstellar interesting but ultimately
failing. What kind of audience seriously want to see shitty like that?
Compare with my generation who grew up with intelligent and suave
sci-fi like 2001 and Blade Runner. And the anti-natalist Rustin Cohle
is virtually ridiculed by now playing a stupid natalist. Interstellar
is quite simply rubbish. It is trash. It reeks of stupidity and
failure.
"
45,6,"
Interstellar as a movie wasn't bad at all. My only problem with the
movie was how the story conveyed the perspective of the gloominess and
the extended boring and silent moments that made it less interesting.Another problem was the ending, it was totally unexplainable and lame.
So ""why"" do such a great movie, then ruin it with such unnecessary
strange anonymous ending with Anne Hathaway living alone in a seemingly
depressed way, while Matthew Mcconaughey is living in another spiral
world and all of a sudden: The End?! Unless there's a sequel, thats
unacceptable. I know that some may enjoy the visuals and the idea of the after world,
but thats simply letting the viewer feel in some way empty and kind of
regret watching a movie that may be overrated ""a bit"" due to the scenes
I have mentioned before.
"
46,7,"
This is a movie with plenty of things going for it. Great performances,
incredible visual effects, an interesting story, and tons of really
cool concepts, which make for a few genuinely powerful scenes, However,
that doesn't make it the flawless masterpiece of cinematic genius
everybody is labeling it as. There are tons of people giving this movie
10/10 ratings, leading to a user rating of 8.7, and it is now #29 on
the IMDb top 250. WOW! That is a lot of praise! On the top 250,
""Interstellar"" is above ""Casablanca"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"",
""Psycho"", ""Apocalypse Now"", and ""CITIZEN KANE""! According to the users
on IMDb, this movie's better than ""Citizen Kane"", which has been known
as possibly the greatest film of all time!Is is better than ""Citizen Kane""? No, not even close. The film is full
of flaws, the biggest being the runtime. I may never see this movie
again because of how long it felt! It feels like a lot of scenes are
unneeded, and were made just so the movie could be longer, because
Christopher Nolan wanted to make it seem really epic. I'm sure if Nolan
cut a huge chunk of the movie out, it would've been better. A film by
Nolan that is better than this one is ""The Dark Knight"", which has a
somewhat long runtime, but it feels way shorter than it's runtime, and
is extremely entertaining throughout. ""Interstellar"" is so long that it
starts to really drag on and, at times, I began to just zone out.The film is also a bit too dramatic. The dialogue about how ""love
conquers all"" seemed very unnecessarily corny, as well as a few other
select scenes in the movie. However, some sequences were quite
powerful, especially the ending, which, actually, was kind of creepy.
The concept of time was very prominent throughout the film, and it lead
to some pretty creative and powerful sequences.Overall, the film is recommended, but you should be warned that this
movie was LOOOOOOOONG!!!!!!
"
47,3,"
I really wanted to like this movie. After seeing it, I came away
thinking, ""It could have been great.""But alas, there are just too many basic things wrong with it.1. It is somewhat too long for the amount of story. At nearly 3 hours,
there are simply too many sections of it that drag on without enough
progress in the story. Cutting about 1/2 hour out would have picked up
the pace and made it much better2. Too many scientific inconsistencies. They take off from Earth in a
conventional rocket with separating stages needed to escape Earth's
gravity, yet there are scenes when they miraculously jet away from
massive planets many times Earth's size (with gravity at least
comparable to Earth's) in smaller portable vessels.The worst example of this is the reveal that the father actually sent
the ""Stay"" message back through time to his daughter, completely
overlooking the age-old time paradox that if someone from the future
were to communicate to the past and were to alter it in any way, it
would change their very presence in the future. 3. Too many scenes rush through explanatory dialog quickly and with
poor sound fidelity so that it's easy to miss key phrases or
explanations. That happens often in the transmissions from home.4. There's too much jumping around between parallel plots with rapid
cut scenes so it makes the story awkward to follow. For example: When
they lost touch with Romilly and then find him again, 23 years of his
life have gone by. They had discussed the plan earlier, so that the
viewer understood that time would slow down for the ones who left the
ship. They return to the ship and he has aged. That's all good and
consistent (although I pick a bone with the fact that he could have
gone to sleep for much of that time and not aged as much... after all,
they all knew that this would happen).But later, in the scene where Mann has busted Coop's helmet and he's
dying from the ammonia atmosphere, and Brand is madly flying to save
him, we have this great action with him fighting on the planet with
Mann, his helmet gets cracked, he calls Brand, she is flying to save
him. Back and forth it goes... her flying, shouting, ""faster faster
faster!"", Coop gasping for air, Mann walking off being the villain who
can't even look at Coop as he is dying... and then... we have scenes of Romilly figuring out that Mann's data, which he is
extracting from the robot, isn't ""right""...... and then Brand saves Coop, and then the ship with Romilly in it
blows up...What the ???Yes, you can figure it out, but it is very clumsy, and in fact, cutting
back to Romilly tinkering with the robot while Brand is saving Coop
just kills the tension and drama of that sequence. I kept feeling like
cutting back to him was just plain getting in the way.There's too much of this: little bits intercut while something else is
going on. I know they are trying to portray the passing of events at
different speeds and the action on simultaneous worlds, but this
above-mentioned scene is just one example of places where they take
this too far and do it unnecessarily.4. Finally, they play fast and loose with important-sounding
Einsteinian explanations of gravity, time, matter, and black holes,
neatly explaining physical and universal phenomena that simply aren't
true.
"
48,1,"
It starts out somewhat OK, and as a scifi movie, I can accept the idea
with the wormhole, and exploring worlds in a distant galaxy. But the
movie just degrades from there. When he manipulates time by entering a
""gentle"" black hole, the movie reaches a ridiculous low point.I don't claim to know details about space flight or ships, but watching
the movie was frustrating as there are so many details that just feel
wrong, and I was left with way too many ""but why!?""s. It's just not
believable, even in a scifi setting, in my opinion.The only reason I watched it to the end, was to see if the makers
actually managed to finish it off with some dignity - which I feel the
failed to do.The music and effects do sometimes drown out the dialogues (for
dramatic or emotional effects, I think), so it would be helpful to have
subtitles available.
"
49,5,"
My first ever review, and I won't get into the technical aspects of the
film, but like so many others, I found the film to be a huge
disappointment, especially when I had read some ""expert"" reviews giving
it 4/4 stars. I got excited to watch it, but the first 45 Min's dragged
on, and on, and on. I really liked Matthew McConaughey's acting in True Detective. But in
this film, the acting was very poor. I put that down to the direction.
The other characters really did nothing for me either. Again, I put
that down to the direction.When Matthew McConaughey was talking, I was constantly straining to
hear what he was saying. There were times I wished the film had
subtitles.There were a lot of aspects to the film that were ridiculous. If you
were going to come back via a black hole to tell yourself to stay, then
why wouldn't you spell that out clearly? Instead of a bit of paper that
just says ""stay"" why not give the reason as well? And as for the
watch/Morse code/farce on the second hand? Give me a break. Just send a
text message to cell phone using ""the force"". Pffft! The watch bit just
lost it for me. That's when I knew this film was pure cheese.Anyhow, I guess some people like fluff in their movies. But there is no
way that this comes close to any of the Sci-Fi classics like 2001 or
Contact.I've seen Lost in Space TV episodes from the 60's that seemed to have
more credibility.Interstellar? That does not compute!
"
50,4,"
Not sure if you can make sense of the film from this, but here goes:In a future world people can only eat Sweetcorn and begin to look like
the Simpsons. A farmer flies into space, realises he can fix things be
sending messages through gravity and space-time back to his daughter,
and everything is cool again. A Mr Man tries to screw it all up, but he
gets his.I'm not convinced that this film should be so highly rated. - It's too
long - Matthew McMumbly hardly speaks clearly - The story is hard to
follow - The maths makes no sense - The boil-in-the-bag cryogenic
capsules look bad - The sudden jump from being in a 'singularity' to a
hospital bed is bogus - They work out his age by counting the rings in
his leg, like a tree, so he's 124 - The set piece speeches about love
are silly - It's too HollywoodRent Sunshine instead, or Moon which is even better.
"
51,1,"
From the moment this movie started it fell flat. The characterization
development was not there. The plot was barely there and all over the
place throughout the story. I wanted to sleep after 30 to 45 minutes
because the acting was horrible and from even our seasoned favorite
actors. WTH was going on within this almost THREE hours of screen time.
I think a hit of acid may have helped to enjoy this movie as well as to
diffuse the loud overbearing noise called music in it. Then I begin
thinking to myself, ""hey, maybe they dropped some LSD or constantly
hitting some bowls between takes while filming because it felt like I
was in a serious haze of drugs due to everything so da*n flat. (this is
suppose to be humor because I do not do drugs, but I was thinking I may
need something to get through this one because it was painful really
really painful) Poor execution in directing as well as thoughtfulness
within the story trying to be told sorta like constipation.

This is Hollywood's hair-brained attempt to one-up ""Gravity,"" which
swept the Academy Awards the previous year. But just as ""Gravity"" was
full of crap, so is this movie. What did we get? Just more fodder from
Tinseltown producers with over-active imaginations which produced
nearly 3 hours of something that didn't add up, gel, connect or make
any sense. To understand and grasp this movie, first I had to get past
the mumbling dialog of Matthew ""Mush Mouth"" McConaughey. Without the
closed captioning on my TV, I would have missed 80% of what he said.
Moreover, to understand this movie, it would have helped greatly if I
was an expert in/or believed in: 1. Quantum mechanics 2. Quantum
physics 3. Time travel 4. Einstein's theory of relativity 5. Black

Extra-Terrestrial Life. This is another confusing, far-fetched space
movie that is lost in space. If you need a ""Fifth Dimension"" fix, try
the singing group from the 60s. If you want more entertainment or
stimulation, try ""Uncle Buck."" If you want something visually stunning,
go look at a redwood.

Interstellar was not on my 'to watch list' as Nolan has impressed with
just one title - Inception; which had a great cast and the flimsy plot
was overshadowed by DiCaprios usually solid performance.Interstellar was a dismal failure. Yet again the Nolan bros try to
'Einstein' the plot with such annoying irregularities one eventually
stops caring much and instead watch the CGI. Mat McC' and his Batman
voice impersonation was annoying. Matt Damon and his brief appearance
was out of place. The characters did not gel. Overly long and a
ridiculously rushed ending, after an agonizing drip start to the film,
that was far to intelligent for its own good.A +2 hour SNL skit by a pretentious director and scripted with a dose
of equally pretentious sibling.

the film is imho about decisions, or better the lack of the latter by
the guys who conceived it. Whats this film about: some end-of-mankind
future (in detail not very convincing). some drama, an idea of
redefining 'love'. some serious plot holes, some special relativity
trivia. And some nice-to-look-at-transformations from 4d to 2d without
any use of riemannian geometry. Its by far a or *the* reference for a top-scifi-movie.but go ahead and see it. Judge for yourself. maybe in our days,
scifi-movies can only be achieved by scientists themselves. Examples i
would recommend: ""the elegance of the universe"" and ""the fabrics of
cosmos""

First of all, I was really looking forward to Interstellar. First few
months I somewhat regret not going to theater and see it, but
definitely not anymore. Interstellar has to be one of the biggest
letdowns in recent memory. I was expecting intelligent scifi, beautiful
locales and effects and witness the awe of deep space. Instead I got a
dragging, confusing and altogether overlong movie. During the first
hour I was already in belief that I wasn't watching the same movie I
was going to. It was about a father-daughter relationship, which could
be OK if situated in space (Ripley and her daughter/Newt was written
brilliantly) but here it happened in Midwest cornfields. The characters
were farmers, it's understandable, but I quickly learned that the whole
world's population has supposedly turned into farming. Yeah right.
Still conveniently the father (McConaughey) used to pilot for Nasa as
well, and when he suddenly finds out a hidden Nasa base, he is
instantly asked to fly a spaceship into space. Just like that. He even
admitted that he hasn't been in space and hasn't even flown in about
ten years. No wonder the US government won't support Nasa if they make
such ridiculous decisions.When Interstellar finally speed warps us into space (as like the tech
stuff was less important than witnessing crops die for almost an hour)
we get mostly unimpressive scenery and effects. Only thing I liked in
the movie, visually that is, was the black hole from distance.
Beautiful. Other that that, bland, boring, uninteresting. The two
planets they landed were so empty and barren, almost like early
computerized, wired virtual worlds that had nothing in there. If either
of these would be mankind's future home, I would rather die on Earth. I
mean come on, water world with only two feet deep water and a mile high
tidal waves. Sure there was a black hole nearby, that would have a huge
gravitational pull, like a million times stronger than our Moon. But in
that case, wouldn't it be clear that this planet is not habitable? The
crew even had to carefully calculate the trajectory to land there.
Otherwise they would have sucked into black hole, like I think would
happen to the planet also in not too distant future. It's not like it's
a star that has matching gravitational pull to stay there. Heck, Earth
doesn't even have enough pull to prevent the Moon from escaping some
day.Technologies aside the character development was just lazy. McConaughey
wasn't very convincing as a man who was going to save the world. He was
more believable as a farmer that had a hobby of flying miniature
airplanes and snatching drones. Hathaway looked like she was lost
during most of the movie. Her relationship with the other characters
was non existent. I felt sorry for Romilly, because he had to wait for
20 years for others to return from water planet, and meanwhile they
were basically just lallygagging down there. Mann at first seemed like
a decent guy but suddenly wen't berserk for no reason, considering he
was in cryo most of the time (I would have expected that from Romilly).
The same can be said of prof Brand. He seriously must have been insane
to come up with a covert operation like that to send their supposedly
best men to a one-way trip through a wormhole. The robot was maybe the
worst design ever. At first I didn't even notice to whom Cooper was
talking to after he was caught lurking outside the Nasa base. Tars
looked like a wall with a display in it, and suddenly when it moved I
was in disbelief. In all sense I would expect it to have been clumsy
and impossible to maneuver but it rotated and morphed into whatever
form when necessary. C-3PO had human shape but it's movement was
intentionally limited to appear as a believable robot.I think Nolan and co were too inspired by 2001:Space Odyssey that they
tried to recreate something visually as epic but never managed to do
so. It's like they weren't even trying. I guess Hollywood studios must
have a database for stock space model designs and textures that Nolan
used, because the creativity was lacking big time. I recently watched a
Blu-Ray version of 2001:Space Odyssey and was still blown away by the
visuals, and that's something made almost five decades ago. Also there
wasn't much going on in the audio department, just a lot of LF effects.
Audio-visually Gravity was superior, and Contact was better written and
it's wormhole effect nicely executed. The ending was surprising, but thinking it afterwards it makes even
less sense. Like the movie as a whole. Cooper meeting his descendants
and his daughter felt awkward, as no one in the room seemed to care who
he was. So why should I?I really liked Inception. It was a scifi movie about dreams. I don't
known what Interstellar really is. A realistic space movie it is not,
that is for certain. A scifi maybe? No, too boring. A drama then?
Perhaps, if you can stomach it.

The first movie I've almost walked out of and I've seen many terrible a
movie.Full of plot holes. Terrible mix of science and full on fantasy
rubbish. The acting isn't great.I really don't understand what people see in this film.Wish I hadn't wasted however many minutes of my life it was on for and
the countless hours later having to vent about how terrible it was.Please I implore you, do not waste your life watching this drivel, if
you enjoy it then you'd probably also find a balloon on a stick
entertaining (bouncy! bouncy!).

The movie delivers some remarkable achievements in cinematography but
it cannot be saved. It's naive, boring, silly, tearful and brings the
irksome feeling that a decent filming and acting were wasted on a messy
story that can be digested only if one leaves aside all their critical
thinking. I'm still wondering what is the big flaw of the storyline: is
it the fact that it's made out of air, so thin that it resembles
vacuum, or is it the super-fast delivery of the
space-time-anomaly-behind-the-library explanation of the whole point,
right after the ridiculous
safe-exit-from-a-spacecraft-inside-a-black-hole drama.Given the overall score here and the reaction of people around me, this
movie is a paradox... It provokes contrasting opinions, so inexplicable
to the opponent, that it reminds me of #thedress.

This film is another film in a long line of films from Nolan, where all
the substance is in the craft.Nolan is not Spielberg, although he tries at times hard to emulate him.
Spielberg, whose main weakness is simplicity of human emotion and
stubborn inability to explore the gray areas of the human condition, is
both a great technician and has a strong grasp of film making
essentials, such as pacing/character development/connecting with the
audience/communicating his vision...Nolan generally lacks in all these skills. He's a great craftsman, but
he has no idea what the hell his own film is about. There's no vision
in this film. No perspective. No character development. No connection
with the audience. The pacing is bordering on amateurish; he speeds up
when he should be slowing down, and slows down when he should be
increasing the pace or maintaining the pace.These film making nuances fly over Nolan's silly, endlessly pretentious
head.He thinks putting in a ludicrous, nonsensical and blatantly
pseudo-scientific twist at the end will save this schlock from
mediocrity.It doesn't. I found myself sighing and rolling my eyes and shaking my
head.This film, when all is said and done, is another missed opportunity to
create something truly inspiring; epic even.This was not a film to give to a master craftsman. It's a shame
Spielberg passed this on, because in more capable hands this could have
been a masterpiece.Instead, it's just a technically proficient hollow shell of a movie
that has already been forgotten by most.This will not become the classic that Nolan dreamed it would. 2001: A
Space Odyssey this is not.Not even close.

I'm just gonna say that I'm very disappointed. Went to cinema with high
expectations after seeing 9.2 score here on IMDb and I after reading
some of the reviews here as well.The realistic score would be somewhere around 7.0 and I am giving it 1
star just to bring current rating down as much as possible since the
movie is highly overrated! Producers probably hired excellent PR team
and those guys are doing a hell of a job to promote this movie! I'm big
Sci-Fi genre fan but this movie has so many plot holes, underdeveloped
characters, it's too long and for moments even boring. Visual effects?
Poor comparing to Gravity or even Prometheus.Should you see this movie? If you are a big SCI-FI fun, I'd say yes,
but set your expectations low and perhaps you find it worth seeing.

This is my first review, and I am compelled to write it t counter all
the 10 star ratings.This is possibly the worst movie ever made.I fell asleep several times, and would have left had I not been sitting
in the middle of the row of seats.I wanted to ask for my money back at the end of the film.It's just boring and nonsensical.Why is every actor in the movie crying all the time?Why does MM mumble/whisper all his lines?I felt no emotional connection to any of the characters, and didn't
care if they lived or died.I heard this was an amazing movie and was looking forward to seeing it,
but the only thing amazing about it is how much money and talent was
turned into such a big steaming pile of dog excrement.

One of the worst movies ever. Painful. For ridiculously drugged out
people or those lacking any knowledge whatsoever (take your pick)Overacted, and pretentious. Moronic actors using big words with a total
lack of understanding of what they mean. I never want to see Anne Hathaway again... ever. I only want to see
McConaughey was even worse, if that is possible.I feel sorry for the actors who played small parts in this movie. I
formerly had respect for most of them. Some of the pictures were pretty cool. Too bad the dialog didn't rise
to the level of the cinematography, but neither did the storyline. The
characters were not fully developed in the story. It was silly.
"
62,6,"
Interesting in parts, but I aged 23 years watching it. Derivative of
many other films including Contact, 2001, Forbidden Planet, Signs and
most egregiously North by Northwest. Worst score in recent memory.
Also, some of the special effects are pretty lame--all too obvious when
models are being used. Gravity was much more visually arresting. Way
too many close up horror expressions. The universe is supposed to be
filled by interstellar gas, which must be true, given so much gassy
dialog. Nolan manages to work in the Do Not Go Gently Into That Good
night poem not once, but four times (look for the last time on a plague
at the end.

I really like Nolan and like all of its films until I saw Interstellar.
The movie has its moments but in between those moments there is lot of
time waste. This is one movie that I really wanted to see but in
between the movie I was thinking when is this going to get over. I
think Nolan could not decide between making a sci-fi movie and an
emotional movie. He has given an average movie and because its a Nolan
movie I have given it a 1star. I know it doesn't really deserve 1star
but then I am angry with IMDb. There is no way it should be rated 9. I
think, lately IMDb has become a hub where marketing people raise the
rating through any means available. Disappointed in Nolan and IMDb too
!!!

Save your money and your time. Except that the CGI moments were great
(but were better done in the new ""Cosmos"" TV series and the film
""Gravity""), this film at nearly every level of filmmaking was boring.
This certainly would be true if you have no interest whatsoever in
science fiction or fact. I had problems enjoying this film on several
levels: 1. The annoying musical score: Never seemed to fit the moment,
bombastic. 2. The over-the-top soap opera-type melodrama: All
characters it seemed carried an unlimited supply of angst and tears. 3.
The irritation of trying to hear the actors mumble inane dialogue,
especially Michael Caine. 4. Burning corn fields look like Iraq oil
fields on fire. 5. After 23 years, the watch left on the bookshelf
still ticking and evidently keeping time. 6. Chasing speeding drone
through cornfield with a flat tire all with a smooth ride. 7. Hollywood
""Wild-west-type"" mano-mano fist-fight between Damon & McConaughey in
air tight space suits, through a worm hole on an ice planet in another
galaxy far, far away. 8. Midway and unexplained appearance of the
Topher Grace character. 9. Sets and props often looked like they were
borrowed from ancient TV show ""Twlilight Zone"" 10. Absolutely zilch
on-screen chemistry among actors. 11. Poor Ellen Burstyn looking so
artificial in all that heavy latex and make up.I quit, you get the picture of this picture. Awful!

The story was initially promising, but after mission start of the film
had unfortunately many lengths, it would have been better to put this
place 2h 3h.The whole film has somehow worked very pieced together ...The SciFi ideas were sometimes quite OK, but not consistent. In Star
Trek z. B. the makers have previously carefully considered to create a
coherent picture to. In this film, here it creates the rocket spaceship
with his ridiculous drive to escape the pull of the black hole ...The special effects were on the level of 90 years ... since I've been
hoping for much more. I went because of the extremely good reviews on
IMDb in this film and am just disappointed ...

I am sorry but found this movie to be highly over rated. It was high on
visual effects but low on the content in terms of script, story and the
future of the world basically.I am sure it will grab few awards in
these categories.There was a similar hype around Avatar but when I saw Avatar, it had
something new to offer. Interstellar doesn't offer anything new as
such.If you put the movie Gravity and the movie Frequency together in
5D, wormhole angle, you have Intersetllar.In fact I found Frequency to
be highly underrated movie.Acting/Direction is good but wished the script were much more stronger.

No need for a spoiler here. the ending is so bizarre, unbelievable, and
pretentious. it is the type of ending a Hollywood director on LSD might
make. That being said, Nolan does make the 5th dimension a
reality--stupidity. I can't believe the yawning of 10s and 9s. I guess
you cannot trust the critics or the movie audience anymore. if you
believe that movies should be believable, coherent, and enjoyable then
you fail the test to see this move. period. So my advice to you is
simple, read the book first. oh wait, there is no book? that is because
there isn't a publishing company that would print it. let me give you a
line from the movie, and you tell me if it is worth seeing. ""Who are
they?"" ""I dunno, but they are real and wanted us to be here."" That is
because We are they."" oooookaaay.

I love science fiction. I love Chris Nolan films. I love creativity,
genius, art, film making. I just didn't love this film.Firstly, the plot was obvious, the 'ghost' was incredibly transparent
right from the moment it's mentioned for example. Michael Caine is, as always, perfectly cast but somehow feels
completely overused now in a Nolan film and it showed here. I
understand the need for gravitas and an A-lister but for Interstellar
it has become a tired cliché. Matt Damon ? My God, it's full of
(film)stars but the bonkers astronaut was done better with Sunshine.
Matthew and Anne put in fine performances but the connection is
lacking. And frankly, I really expected so much more than the contrived
'love and humanity' theme. When Anne waffles her way through her
reasoning for a particular decision point in the film I had to do a
mental 'double-take'.This film tries so hard to be a 2001: A Space Odyssey for the
millennial generation and fails. Even the heavy organ soundtrack is too
reminiscent of Kubrick. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be homage or a
meant as a direct comparison. All it needed was a bunch of monkeys.The visuals: they're good, but they're not spectacular like everyone
gushes. I think Gravity held more beauty and impact than this. The
wormhole sequence, despite clinging to science and projecting an image
of a 3 dimensional gateway as closely as possible was just flat.The best scenes ? You'll wish you saw more of TARS and CASE, the robots
that look like 2001 monoliths miniaturised. They have the best lines.I've always paid to watch a Nolan film more than once at the cinema, in
some cases 3 or 4 times because of the story, acting and visual impact.
I have no inclination to do so for this film, and that has shocked me
most of all.
"
69,3,"
Rather disappointed in that movie. As with many new Sci-fi, the viewer
in drown in a sea of special effect to cover a poor story line. This
movie is crafted in pure scientist hubris, and is a lengthy attempt at
explaining how humanity would self explain itself. In front a the great
mystery of the meaning and origin of life, some people seems unable to
accept that a few things might transcend us and would rather explain
everything by our future genius and awesomeness...Because there is no limit to what we will be, right? It is like 2001
Space Odyssey: massively overrated. The intellectual dilemma of the
story is whether humanity is to be seen as a collection of individuals,
or as a species, and the answer seems to be that we would be maybe our
creator and self little helpers. Humanity as a stepping ladder to
itself, out of darkness and non existence. Rather sad...
"

Unfortunately, Interstellar in another Sci-Fi movie that failed to make
a consistent clever scenario with good scientific related dialogues
that make sense and do not try to impress the audience with wambly
bubbly magical solutions and unreal metaphysics. The dialogues are
stupid as hell, the events are complete unrealistic and unclever (and
unoriginal). The idea and the graphic are very good but as I pointed before this
movie suffers from the Pop Sci-Fi syndrome plus the need of Hollywood
to have a protagonist-hero style-ultra soldier patriot who stupidly
takes the solution to himself (like the scene who rides the spaceship
without the auto-pilot or the fact the NASA put his hope into a guy who
just showed up in his secret door etc...). Everything around Matthew
McConaughey it's so boring cliché and shallow for such a budget movie.The 5/10 is a reflection of a nice idea plus the work of the CGI and
the physicists who worked to make the simulations for the ultra-realist
black holes.
"
71,6,"
Sound - 1/2 - The score is bombastic, and the dialog is occasionally
hard to hear. Acting/Characterization - 1/2 - McConaughey has the rebel cowboy act
down pat but is a little less credible as a scientifically-minded
father. The other characters are undeveloped and exist to represent
specific ideas. Script/Writing - 0/2 - The script is a hodgepodge of corny tag lines
and poorly executed themes. Visuals - 2/2 - The fate of humanity apparently rests on the
colonization of bleak planets in bleak space, but at least there are
cool wormholes, black holes, and baseball fields. Concept (Plot/Theme) - 1/2 - Interstellar deserves at least one point
for ambition and creativity, but too many questionable plot
developments are thrown together, and the film does not seem to commit
to any of its ideas or themes, though some, such as time dilation, are
certainly fascinating. When not confounded by possible paradoxes or
superficial musings on love, one is left to question the viability of
an anti-intellectual society portrayed with such unexplained cynicism,
as well as the human imperative to survive on other planets when the
species is apparently inclined to destroy its own natural habitat.Total Score - 5/10 Gut Feeling - 6/10 - For a film espousing the virtues of love and
exploration, Interstellar has little emotional resonance. Plotwise,
it's a memorable mess.Final Average - 5.5/10
"
72,6,"
We have to start by acknowledging that C. Nolan has been, for a while,
Hollywood's golden boy and, as such, people will undoubtedly deify him;
such is the dynamic of this strange and absurd system we live in. Thus,
we can understand all the hype this movie receives, regardless of its
authenticity.As, for me, from the beginning, after the ""ghost"" is mentioned, I saw
clearly how that was going to develop; such obviousness scores quite a
few negative points for the Nolan brothers' imagination, creativity and
originality. Something disappointing, taking in consideration some of
the previous works. There's definitely more predictability in this
movie than in previous ones, or so was my impression. Particularly, I
see a bit too many similarities in ideas, cinematography and even
music, to 2001. Apart from that, all that sentimentalism could have been turn down a
notch, and clearly the whole ""love"" concept. Still, there's much less
of that than what you can find is the vast majority of productions
nowadays (something that tells us how low the level of quality of
movies and series is). Interesting how Matthew McConaughey was also
involved in Contact, a movie that also touches one or two points
present in Interstellar. Fortunately, the level of sentimentalism
doesn't reach those of Contact and, even better, this movie doesn't
dwell in god and such nonsense (something which killed Gravity for me).Although the special effects are no doubt very good, all the talk about
IMAX and so on made me expect something much more impressive in that
department.The story itself was, for me, a bit weak, and some points seemed to be
connected with each others just ""because"", or by very fragile threads.
For all the praise I've heard about Interstellar ""science"", I've seen a
good few unexplained ""scientific"" events in the movie which just seem
to be taken for granted, and I can't see the science behind them
anywhere.The fact that this is a story -once again- about how to make humanity
survive didn't help my opinion, since there's no real intelligent
reason, apart from selfishness and survival instincts, to see our
species perpetuated along with its destructive behaviour towards all
other lifeforms and itself. That makes me connect to the ""fake moon
landing"" scene, and how all these recent NASA movies might be part of
some sort of propaganda machine to, once more, makes us look up to the
stars instead of caring more for our planet and trying to stop and
reverse all the misery we have been, for centuries, bringing upon it
and all its inhabitants.Alas, not a bad movie to watch, but certainly not the shining jewel
they want us to believe this is. As I said at the beginning, that's how
the system (and thus, the masses), work.
"
73,3,"
Just wow. Where do I start? Should I start with the tongue-in-cheek
Scientific ""accuracy"" of this movie? Hans Zimmer's music and its often
wrongly timed placement in the movie? The family melodrama? Or how
about the fact it takes itself rather seriously or its lack of sense of
humor? Let us first go through this: genre: science fiction, plot: save
mankind, director: Christopher Nolan, writers: Jonathan Nolan and
Christopher Nolan, year of release: 2014, themes: humanity, pollution,
despair, hope, love and extraterrestrial contact. Summary: Mankind is
at the brink of extinction, therefor sends a team of astronauts to
search and investigate whether Exoplanets are habitable or not. To show
how tongue-in-cheek this movie is when it comes to Scientific accuracy,
I am going to compare it to Dario Argento's ""Phenomena"". Like this
movie, ""Phenomena"" used the science of its time to give its narrative
thrust. There was for example the Patau Syndrome, used in ""Phenomena""
and then it used the theory from back then that insects can communicate
through telepathy plus, giving the main character the ability to use
telepathy to communicate with insects. Oh and the movie got a razor
blade wielding chimpanzee. Also it uses insects to forward the plot
since insects have been actually used in murder investigations and hey,
the main character can communicate with insects! It is science and
theory of its time. The Patau Syndrome can occur and it does occur,
chimpanzees can use tools and it is scientifically proved chimpanzees
kill too.Sounds unbelievable? Yes, it is very tongue-in-cheek. It requires a lot
of suspension of disbelief. It is the same thing with ""Interstellar"".
The extraterrestrials used their mystical powers to make sure Cooper
gets to the Space station so he can go to outer Space? Plausible. Use
the limited resources at hand to arrange an interstellar travel?
Plausible. Travel through a Worm hole? Plausible. Enter a Black hole?
Gah... More like impossible since the gravitational forces would likely
shatter our hero to pieces. Enter a fourth dimension which aliens
created to help us where past and future are happening at once? Now
we've left any kind of logic! The Fourth dimension has been a subject
of study for centuries but it is so far nothing but a concept and not
an actual theory. Set a movie's plot with one or two plausible causes?
Fine. But 4 or 5 plausible causes set right after another? Too much.
Too much because it asks for a lot of suspension of disbelief and
considering it is supposed to be scientifically accurate and believable
it certainly does asks its audience to suspend a lot of disbelief. It
is like watching a man tripping on his own legs and fall hard on the
floor. How about the sentimentality of the Family melodrama? With its
shallow characters it tries to be deep about its characters and the
family's bond. ""Love can save the whole Earth, even though we have
polluted it to the point of no return, we shall use our Family love to
get access to extraterrestrial technology and save Earth!"" If that does
not make you raise your brow and wrinkle your nose in disbelief, I
don't know what does.Hans Zimmer's music cuts in between dialogues by the way, the director
spends half the movie making the characters explain the movie to the
audience and then Zimmer's music interrupts and makes the dialogues
almost inaudible. Talking about a man tripping on his own feet again.
Seriously, what is it with Christopher Nolan and his tendency to
explain the obvious over and over again? Is he afraid the audience are
too dumb to do some healthy mental reasoning? Oh, right. He himself
admitted he is a pessimist. Seriously it is mind numbing. But the worst
part is it takes itself rather seriously and have no self irony or
sense of humor whatsoever. At least ""Phenomena"" itself knew it was a
fantasy/horror, mixing elements of fairy tale with some strange
tongue-in-cheek science, grisly murders and a sick sense of humor with
a sense of self irony. Dario Argento also does not spend half his
movies making the characters explain the movie to the audience. So I
would say ""Interstellar"" is as scientifically accurate as ""Phenomena""
and Christopher Nolan is the opposite of Dario Argento. Which is
ironic, since Nolan is a mainstream director cited as one of the
greatest directors ever lived who is a pessimist. Argento, a
controversial director who is often accused of being a misogynist who
makes politically incorrect movies full of pessimism who in reality is
an optimist since he believes his audience can do some reasoning to
understand his movies. I choose Dario over Christopher, since
Christopher in my opinion makes holier than thou movies and Dario makes
movies with self irony.But I choose to be kind and give this movie 3 out of 10 instead of 1.
Although I generally feel ""Interstellar"" is a hyped movie that is
overrated.

Glad I waited to watch this on an already paid for subscription online.This movie showed so much promise and I found myself laughing at the
frivolous attempts at pretending to understand physics. They could have
used Science Fiction to the full extent of the unknown and blown the
effects out of the water, but rather, they used half-witted science to
try and make the concepts realistic.The other half of the movie I was laughing at the sad attempt to
establish some sentimental relationship between characters. All too
often relationships were summarized in a poor attempt at back fill. The beginning of the movie was confusing and near the end of the movie
I found myself playing with my dog rather than even trying to watch.Don't get your hopes up.

I'm a big fan of anything Sci-Fi and I've always been interested in the
boundaries that directors push when it comes to imagining the
impossible and predicting or presenting the future on screen. While
most science fiction films step over into the fantastical and often
prioritize the ""Fi"" over the ""Sci"", Interstellar is one of those rare
gems that balances the two elements and also delivers a spectacularly
entertaining movie.Any doubts I had going into the film about a dramatic SciFi being
directed by Christopher Nolan were instantly muted as soon as the movie
and its tremendous score began. While Nolan excelled with The Prestige
and Inception, they did leave something to be desired and I was fresh
off the Batman trilogy bandwagon. But Nolan excels yet again, directing
the film with such confidence and control that it's almost impossible
to tear your eyes away from the screen. Each and every aspect of his
signature style is also prominently visible through the film.Continue reading the review at my blog below:https://microreels.wordpress.com/2015/11/25/interstellar-film- review/

Interstellar is a science fiction film co-written and directed by
Christopher Nolan (Inception, Batman: The Dark Knight etc.) and
starring Matthew McConaughey. I found it absolutely amazing, rarely do
I use a word like 'spellbinding' to describe a movie but I really do
feel like Interstellar is well worthy of it. Matthew McConaughey was
excellent as well. He really shows the great emotional range he has as
an actor.The story is about a group of explorers, led by former pilot and
engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who embark on a journey through
a newly discovered wormhole near the planet Saturn. Their main mission
is to save humanity from extinction by an environmentally devastated
Earth.The film was not only beautiful to look at, but it was very well
written too. However, like with Inception, you REALLY need to pay
attention to pretty much everything that happens to fully understand
what is going on. It's difficult for me to go into too much detail
without giving away important plot points so you'll just have to see
for yourself.I rate it a very high 9.5/10 and I highly recommend it to any fan of
Christopher Nolan and anyone who enjoys intelligent science fiction. I
personally consider it one of the best and most thought provoking
science fiction films I've ever seen.

Was this movie terrible? No, but for as much praise as it got, I'm
astounded. The plot was ridiculous and unbelievable. That isn't what
killed the movie however, it was the acting! Maybe the director wanted
the actors to act that way, but every time they did something amazing,
they barely acted surprised. It was as if it was all in a days work.
This is the sole reason why I can't get myself to re- watch this movie.
The visuals were amazing, but I'm more interested in plot lines and
character development than pretty effects (call me old school, even
though I'm in my 20's). The movie tries to be like 2001: A Space
Odyssey, but falls short. 2 months after watching Interstellar, not
much is retained in my memory (I had to re-read the ridiculous plot and
re-watch a trailer to bring my memory back). Whereas 2001 I watched 6
or so months ago and remember most of it. It may seem like I'm calling this movie terrible, it's not. It's just
highly overrated and I need to point out the flaws that keep this from
being a masterpiece. Maybe I've seen too many programs about space
(Cosmos, The Universe, 2001, etc) that keep this movie from stunning me
with the visuals, but if you're a person that has not seen too many
space programs, you'd probably like it. And just an FYI, this is coming from a guy that hated Gravity and
Inception. If you like those, you may like this movie.

This film, although billed as a sci-fi, is really about loss,
mortality, apathy and love. The sci-fi element creates a canvass to
show off some cgi and add a bit of adventure but little else. The
science is where the film shoots itself in both feet. The film tries to justify the plot with elements of theory which is a
bit dull and restrictive; yet the story is riddled with plot holes and
inconsistencies that it could have got away with if it wasn't taking
itself so seriously. The film is concerned entirely around its characters' emotions. So if a
big meteor storm is on its way you will get 30 minutes of people
worrying about it, 3 minutes of meteor storm then another 30 minutes of
people reflecting on its aftermath. This makes a very long film feel
even longer. I found this entertaining and it is very well made with great
performances and production. I found it unnecessarily long. It also
suffers from crop circle syndrome  with an omnipotent technology why
not just send a text and stop messing about with charades. My
girlfriend didn't want to watch it but instead of hating it she was
just indifferent.
"
79,6,"
I don't get the hype for this film. It could have been so much more.
The end was less about space travel, and more about unbelievable
sci-fi. I like Sci-Fi's that are at least remotely believable. This
movie becomes hard to follow at the end with all the sci-fi twists. The
character development is fairly good, and for that I rated the movie
slightly above average. However, with almost 3 hours, character
development should be expected. The visual effects are pretty good,
with the exception of the unbelievable near ending. I'm just not sure
this movie was worth the 3 hours invested in watching it. If you're a
McConaughey fan, you'll probably enjoy the movie. If you're not a fan,
you could be disappointed.

Hey Guys It's Quinn C from Youube. Well first off, the visuals in this
film are absolutely stunning. I saw this film in a bad theatre, a dome
theater if you've ever been in one of those, but even still the visuals
were awesome. CAnd the score, although I believe it to be pretty bad
and I'll explain in a bit as to why, but the score literally shook the
building, so this film really was an experience more than anything
else. I truly believe that this film can only be truly viewed in a
theatre.But my god, it turned ugly for this film real quick. The first reason
was the audio was difficult to hear a lot of the times. Not only was
there I guy shouting 'WOW' or 'HES BEHIND THE BOOKCASE' who sat next to
me, but the score was so damn loud that you can't hear what people are
saying. But then again people argue that this film isn't about the
dialogue, but the message. Fair enough, fair enough.My main problem with this film and why I dedicate an entire video to it
is because the ending is arguably the most infuriate, devoid of logic,
waste of 3 hours of potential that has ever existed on this planet.
Heavy spoilers right here, but you've had time for this film so here it
is:After narrowly escaping 'Dr Man', ending the most obviously forced
message outside of murf saying 'man is corrupted and destroyed the
planet', McConaughey goes into a black hole, unharmed, to send morse
code message to his daughter through a book case in another dimension
to tell her the secrets to the universe. Through love. He then gets to
his daughter, who basically tells him to go away. and then the movie
ends. I'll just give a moment for that to soak in.OK, what is the purpose of having an entire movie based heavily on
science, and I mean heavy, just for a series of bull things to occur
for no reason at all. First of all, going to the bottom of a pool hurts
your head, so how a black hole wouldn't crush McConaughey immediately
is beyond me. But fine I'll let it go. Then, to have him send morse
code because love permits him, and then to crush the entire theme of
the film by having murf flip him off basically just makes no sense. It
also doesn't work cause McConaughey doesn't care about his son the
entire time, the crew gets screwed because they love people which bits
them in the ass, but after all of this love is the only way for
McConaughey to send his message to murf at the end.So what I'm trying to say is that this film is just a bunch of
contradictions. It uses science to explain stuff but then uses love to
propel the plot, people use love to do stuff but it never benefits
them, and love is ultimately how McConaughey gets home, just for him to
leave again within 10 minutes.Now there are parts I love. I thought everything on the ocean planet
was great, the robot thing was awesome, and the first 2 hours were
great, but the ending is so infuriating and borderline paradox like
that the film ends up making no sense.Now please don't say I don't get the film. I got the film 100%, it's
just this movie literally makes no sense. You can't just go into a
black hole and survive, and if your father comes back to you after 100
years, you aren't just gonna push him out of the room. The scientists
act on emotion, not logic like most all astronauts, and overall, this
film just bothers me then brings any joy. Unlike blade runner which I'd
probably like after another viewing, this film will always go down as
my biggest disappointment of a film; With a score of 5.6, you should
just stop watching as soon as mr man dies, trust me.If you guys want more in depth reviews, please be sure to check me out,

Ho hum! The planet is dying. No more astronauts needed, farmers needed
now, 'cause the crops are failing... What the heck will the farmers do
in a dust bowl? It happened once and they went to L.A. So the astronaut
turned farmer finds a secret NASA base next to his corn field. Turns
out his daughter will grow up to be another Einstein. So, said
astronaut-farmer goes out in outer space to save Mankind and fights
with another astronaut on another world, and blah, blah, blah. Oh! And
there's this black hole, really the star of the film, no pun intended,
not to mention the many down to Earth holes in the plot. Very
disappointing. On the plus side, the photography is nice. If you don't
know anything about space, or about science, do go see it. It might
blow your mind. If it gets people to care a bit more for the future,
that's worth a passing grade in my opinion.

I do not know why anyone likes this movie. I have seen many SF movies
and had high expectations when going to the theatre. Such a big
disappointment.Clearly the director tries to remake the Stanley Kubrick movie, ""2001,
a Space Oddessey"". A failure however. Yeah some spectacular images of
Saturn...but that is not sufficient.Really nothing happens and the characters are not really believable.
For me a waste of money and time...I gave it a 3 for the special effects but the storyline is hardly worth
a 2/10...
"
83,5,"
Ooo - what a disappointment. I expected something new, not this.I was looking for back story on the state of the climate, but it didn't
come. Doubt set in when the exploration theme was raised, with the
teacher denying the moon landing. Totally out of left-field, nothing to
do with the story. Then the hero turns up at the NASA base - I know
it's not random and that this thing loops back on itself, but it just
felt odd rather than intriguing.Then the main theme is set up - love may be the ultimate survival
adaptation. But they did nothing with it.Then we're through the wormhole, but the story shows almost total lack
of curiosity about this new environment. No real attempt to present
strange worlds. A big wave in ankle deep water - fair enough. A frozen
planet - uuuh, Norway?At this point I was hungry for a bit of action. And we did get
treachery - clearly flagged (no touchy my computer) - leading to a ...
punch up. Exciting.The end is nice and safe, with double-optimism all around. But don't
mention the fact we're already running out of cheap oil. Without that
the best we can manage is inter-village hog barter with hand-crank
shower units. Do I lack faith?
"
84,2,"
Christopher Nolan does sci-fi... to which I feel like saying to this
hitherto great director, don't bother! The cinematography is great but
that's about it, otherwise it's like 2001, Blade Runner and Star Trek
all thrown into a blender with a shot of gratuitous emotional hysteria
carved out of a soap opera sub-plot, or perhaps left over from Ann
Hathaway's Les Mis histrionics. Meanwhile Matthew McConaughey croaks
away like some Field-of-Dreamsesque sharecropper catapulted into space
for no obvious reason like it's a case of mistaken identity or
something. Way too long and all but the most hardened space cadets will
bale out before re-entry.
"
85,5,"
In my view there are two types of science fiction. The first type wants
to wow us with science and must therefore be faithful to it. The second
type wants to tell us one of those universal stories (boy meets girl -
who turns out to be his sister, then meets evil guy who turns out to be
his dad etc...) and uses 'science' very loosely as a way of isolating
and highlighting the story.Some science fiction makes the mistake of trying to do both. This film
is one such mistake. The basic story that love conquers all, even space
and time is a good one. And to focus on the love between a parent and a
child offers an interesting perspective. But first we have to go
through a wormhole and skim through an event horizon. Actually that's
all OK. The problem is the plot device that Earth is dying and our best
hope is colonising one of a selection of planets that appear to be far
worse options. How can it make more sense to move to a frozen planet or
a desert planet orbiting a black hole than to just fix the Earth? The film spends quite a while setting up the Earth is dying scenario.
Unfortunately it's far from convincing. Luscious green corn on a huge
mechanised super farm is occasionally lightly coated with a little
dust. We are told that corn is all we have left because other crops are
succumbing to 'blight', and it's only a matter of time before corn is
next. So, instead of using any kind of genetic engineering to try and
counter this we opt for a giant space ark and shipping everyone off
through that wormhole. It also seems rather odd that a supposed global
food crisis hasn't led to conflict, crime or indeed any kind of
apparent suffering.The next highly implausible offering is Cooper (Matthew McConaghy)
stumbling into a 'secret' NASA base with a giant rocket hidden inside.
If we've learnt nothing else from Snowden it is that Americans can't
hide anything! Although, to be fair, the film does at least poke fun at
American credulity by having schools teach that the moon landings
actually were faked. And then to top it all the scientists pick this
bloke who's just wandered in to pilot a spaceship he's never seen
before. But I will come back to that.So they trundle off into space in what looks like a Saturn 5 before
transferring into more Star Wars like spacecraft. There's a bit of
cryogenic sleep, some time dilation and some robot stuff which
obviously references 2001 and the Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy
(that at least is a good thing!). Then there is some ludicrous nonsense
as they land on a water world where the sea is 18 inches deep but waves
are half a mile high (where does the water come from? - maybe that
doesn't stretch the credulity of an American audience 40% of whom think
Noah is a documentary). Next is an ice world with solid clouds...Here they meet Mann (Matt Damon). Now, suddenly it gets interesting
when he turns out to be a bit unhinged and some genuine tension is
developed. You really get a sense of the last part of 2001 here as we
feel the loneliness and the characters' reliance on fragile 'rafts' in
the vast emptiness of space. That parallel is further explored as
Cooper falls into the black hole and things get very weird, multi
dimensional and spiritual. Here we see him trapped in a fifth dimension
trying to communicate with his daughter in a way that earlier in the
film was prefigured as some kind of paranormal activity.Because this doesn't make sense scientifically - it does make sense as
a piece of story telling. And if you buy into the idea that Cooper is
part of some time looping master plan to save the human race then you
might accept his selection to pilot the mission (see above).Unfortunately, for me this is all spoiled because the Nolans keep
trying to explain it all instead of just allowing it to be a mystery.
Just like the first brilliantly ambivalent Matrix film was subsequently
ruined by its sequels that tried to explain it all, so this film is
undone by trying to be both kinds of sci-fi.
"

So... many are going to disagree with me: but... Interstellar sucked.
50% of this was due to the soundtrack. It's not that I'm super picky
about what amazing tunes should play during my movies. It's just that I
don't think they should make me vomit my brain out of my skull. The
droning, overbearing-soundtrack featured everyone's favorite
instrument: The Dial-tone-xylophone-pipe-organ-flute. This usually hung
on one note in a very high pitched whine, or, if you were lucky, it
would be featured in a cord that replayed over and over again. Not just
replaying though, but getting louder and louder over time, so loud that
one might seriously consider burying their face in molten lava, if only
to escape the assault on one's ears. So loud that the words the
characters are saying can not even remotely be discerned, even in a
very high-class theater, with state-of-the-art audio. However,
remember, this Soundtrack-for-Masochists was only half the reason the
movie was lame.The other half was bad science, overplayed space-movie-tropes and
extremely questionable character decisions.First we have the blight, it's killing every plant on earth with dirt.
Yes ladies and gentlemen, the final blow to humanity will come in the
form of a clingy dust that just won't wash away. Why, or how this came
to be is never explained, but it's killing all the plants and getting
stuck in our lungs, and for some reason it's going to end humanity
because everyone seems to have forgotten how to grow indoor hydroponic
food like with already do with a number of crops. Also, the blight is
somehow, kinda-maybe a biological plague that feeds off nitrogen... or
is it dirt? I don't freakin' know at this point, and the movie doesn't
really help you understand if one is causing the other, or if their the
same thing, or what.Add to that, some excruciatingly poor, or at best implausibly unvetted
decision making, toss in some random space-madness, and after about the
halfway point, the movie became a chore to watch. As Interstellar gets
closer to the end, it starts to seem like a contest in a game of
""wouldn't it be cool if"" before it blessingly concludes with,
everything is fine now because of black holes and gravity, yaay.Save yourself some money by putting on some headphones and plugging
them into a light socket while watching the most contrived and nonsense
episodes of Star Trek. If you can't hear half of the dialog because of
the painful whirring in your ears, you have succeeded in simulating
Interstellar.
"
87,2,"
I have never been more disappointed with a movie, as I had such high
hopes.Many others have gone into the flaws with the story, non-sensical
science, and poor dialogue and I generally agree with the harshest of
those criticisms.But I'd like to add one that isn't being said much: The film is mostly
blurry (a few scenes were sharp so it can't've been the cinema), and
whoever maintains the lenses forgot to clean them as there's specks and
hairs (again, it can't've been the cinema because they varied between
the different scenes). If you see it at an IMAX and have good eyes,
this might bug you. In my opinion there's no gain in seeing it on a big
screen, as it looks like it was shot last century.Nolan's wrong, film-cameras suck (Just compare the image quality of
Interstellar to, say, the Hobbit movies and you can see where movie
technology should be heading). Also, this is exactly the genre of movie
that looks best in 3D. (And to those who don't like 3D: Just see the 2D
version).
"
88,4,"
(Don't read with you didn't watch it already!) I'm giving Interstellar
4 stars because the detail in space is Horrible, no stars, etc.
Originally from the Black Hole Thermodynamics and string theory, the
black hole is the entrance into the void (in between each universe
following string theory). But when cooper goes into the void or into
the black hole, his now apparently into 5th dimension where he can Only
see the history about his life but not anywhere else and relating to
this, in ""Men In Black 3"", There is a alien named Griff than has 5th
dimensional abilities and refers to all history, not only his. The
Screen play is horrible and the theme is toooo dark. Something good
about it is they made all the technology legit and cool. And inferring
from Star Trek (1960's edition), the wormhole looks horrible, since
it's too dark to see it, it doesn't even look like they went through
it. And another part of the black hole, black holes don't occur often,
and the black hole would have enough force to bring all that debris
inside, and I'm referring that that black hole occurred from a super
powerful supernova mixed with a nebula, the dark energy would also be
sucked into the black hole instead of floating around it. Finally, the
ending was horrible, the original plan was when Murphy is 30 something,
cooper would come back. But after, when he escapes from the 5th
dimension black hole, he is just outside of Saturn. Then he is
apparently found in a space station where he should of died. The space
station is like a museum and the walls flip up. Now you saw why I rated
this 4 stars.
"

I went into this movie knowing little about it, no plot details, or
even whether christopher nolan was director or just a producer. I have
enjoyed nolans previous movies, but i don't care who is behind the
camera aslong as the film is serving it's purpose which is to
entertain.So half an hour goes by, the tone is set. There is a crisis with the
crops,earth is running out of food, a lot of dust, no explanation for
any of it, just accept it. the film is pretty humourless and lot of
mumbling about nothing interesting in particular from the lead..he's an
ex nasa pilot who has a farm...sits on the porch drinking a beer and
gets philosophical with john lythgow ...more mumbling. Struggling to
stay awake.Okay so the next act things pick up, we have loud launch into space,
I'm awake again. Then silence, after all that's whats space is like
y'know. Can now hear people munching popcorn. Too quiet. Oh look huge
water planet, vast and empty much like this film so far. Huge wave
comes.Ah some entertainment at last, clunky robot runs around... then
Matt damon ! the last act, blackholes and then there is an semi
interesting twist to earlier events.This was a frustrating film, had a lot of potential with the story but
on an entertaining and thought provoking level it doesn't get there. It
starts and stalls. Did anyone really care about the characters? i
certainly didn't invest. Obviously some people love it with the scores
on here but i cannot agree.This is not a masterpiece in sci-fi by any means. There are comparisons
to 2001 but don't even go there.I actually looked at my watch towards
the end of the film to see how long I'd been trapped in this cinematic
black hole.
"

If the underlying logic is missing, the story overly simplistic and
weak, then spending 160 million on production isn't going to make it a
great movie. The potential is huge but the end result feels lacking.
This may well could have been a real masterpiece with a bit more
thoughtfulness and work. It has some interesting science wrapped around
a meager plot. It may well have sky high ambitions, very good production value, actors
and cgi but the underlying script is just very weak. It lacks even the
most basic logic. How this can be considered as intelligent and
philosophical is beyond me.The science is heavily dumbed-down and simplified, presumably to appeal
to a wide audience. The overall script is extremely simplistic. The
philosophical aspect shallow and empty. The whole is wrapped into a
fantastic presentation but ultimately a hollow experience.Matt Damon gives his worst performance to date (blame the script). Anne
Hathaway looks lost the entire time and completely out of place.
Matthew Mcconaughey flies the spacecraft like hes doing arcade games,
the only thing missing is the occasional 'yeahaaaa!' like a cowboy.I applaud the ambition but overall it's a mess. A mess with silver
linings. BUT STILL WORTH THE WATCH.
"
91,8,"
As I begin this review of Christopher Nolan's latest movie, I want to
point out the gorgeous visuals that we as an audience were able to
behold with Interstellar. I truly believe this to be the movie's best
quality and a true feat for the people in charge of visual effects.
Having said this, I believe that many viewers were divisive over the
plot's complexities. In fact, this is the most emotion driven movie
I've seen from Nolan, something that he isn't ultimately known for.
Nolan's strenght as a director lies in his ability to present us with a
vision. He is meticulous and works the technical aspect of a film like
no other director today. Once again, this is proved in every frame shot
for Interstellar. So leaving behind my long praise, I now redirect this
review to the story.The earth is dying, as the effects of our abuse of the natural
resources is taking out the crops of food we need to survive. Upon this
dark scenario, former NASA engineer Cooper (McConaughey) is asked to
pilot a spaceship with the purpose of crossing a wormhole that will
lead to another galaxy. This, of course, in hopes of reaching three
possible habitable planets explored by scientists sent there in
previous missions. Given the unpredictable nature of an unknown
environment such as a different galaxy, Cooper will have to decide
whether he is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of humanity
or if the urge to reunite with his daughter again is stronger.
Personally I liked the story Nolan told us with this film, as it left
you thinking about it after the movie was over, something Nolan does
very well with his projects. Compared with his previous work, there are
still movies that I love more than this. Still Interstellar is a
brilliant film in it's own right and yet another great addition to this
great director's Filmograhpy.In the end all I can say is, if you're a Sci-Fi fan, you surely must
not miss this one. It will offer an unique visual experience and leave
you wondering what the hell you just watched, even if you didn't feel
completely satisfied.Rating: 8/10
"
92,4,"
Well, this one is another failure movie from Nolan after I saw
Inception (which I find totally rubbish). I waited for this movie such
a long time, it had 9.0 ratings on IDMB, so I thought it would be as
great as Ridley Scott's Prometheus which I like a lot, but this movie
is big disappointment, not even close to Prometheus. Both plot & acting
are boring. Movie is almost 3 hours & when you watch it, it even seems
longer. For the entire movie I was feeling like: ""The best part of the
movie should come soon now"", but it never came. It was so damn boring &
with a stupidly unrealistic scenery. Like little girl can read Morse
code (seriously? Who's interested in a Morse code in modern time?
Especially in children..) & she reads from the ghost who sent her this
codes via bookshell & after several years this girl (which is already
grown adult) somehow finds out that answers of surviving humanity &
disappearance of her father must be in her room where she was reading
these Morse code & at that time her father which is in a black hole &
which is that ghost by the way, is behind that bookshell sending her a
Morse code via clock & his daughter is so damn smart, that she finds
out this everything & saves mankind from the doom, lol. What a dumbass
scenery. Seriously I don't understand how people give this boring movie
9/10. It seems most of those people are just a Nolan blind fanboys or
paid ones. Oh, by the way. we got Hans Zimmer in soundtracks & despite,
that he's very good composer, his compositions doesn't fit this movie
at all. It makes movie more drama, than SCI-FI & actually movie feels
more drama than SCI-FI.
"
93,2,"
In short: I have watched over a 1000 movies and TV shows and consider
this one of the worst high-budget movies of recent years. In fact, it is one of the only movies I walked out on after 30 minutes.
If you are interested in a Space opera, watch Defying Gravity instead,
a low-budget production that easily outshines this horrible Hollywood
production and actually has some believable characters, believable
science and raises some deeper questions. Please note a few spoilers ahead. Excuse the mistakes, I wrote it in a
rush 1 First Things First: The Unrealistic Science & Plot holes A film that talks about science and attempts to be somewhat believable
(and yes the films try to at least appear realistic one some level)
should not have to deal with such absurdities:1) A planet with 70 miles high waves one the one hand and areas where
you can walk in 1-feet deep water close by? Absolutely ridiculous. 2) One of the biggest and laughable points for any Sci-Fi fan is the
time difference on a planet in a different universe compared to Earth.
Landing on a planet cannot magically change time, whereas transitioning
through a space-time tunnel aka wormhole might. And if that planet was
close to the blackhole then the blackhole would simply tear the planet
apart. The movie either got it completely mixed up or failed to
properly explain it. Either way, the fact is, the entire plot is flawed
and it shows. 3) There are countless more plot holes and problems that I will not
address here, you can find countless reviews online that address the
many plot holesAll of that would have been acceptable to me, but then there's the
cast: Both McConaughey and and Anne Hathaway are extremely poor choices
for the roles. 2 Worst Cast For A Hollywood Movie Ever? Emotionless McConaughey And
Hathaway As A Scientist - Who Are You Kidding Hollywood?McConaughey failed to provoke any emotions in the audience: In one
scene Cooper is leaving his family and it's completely emotionless and
the scene itself has less than 5-minutes on screen-time. Where the hell
is the struggle? A guy leaving his family would struggle for days
unless he was a passionate, driven explorer. It did not feel like a
struggle at all.And if that character was such an adventurous, passionate explorer then
they set this character (Cooper) up completely wrong. Either way,
casting a 46-year old McConaughey for this role was just an extremely
poor choice and they only made this casting choice to get more
viewers!! How do you expect a 46-year old to display that kind of
passion? He's an actor sure, but at that age you can't realistically
portray a character who's leaving his family to rescue the planet. It
should have been a 30-year old guy with some kind of burning fire, not
that old worn-out character who's still bearing the visible marks of
portraying a half-dead guy in Dallas Buyers Club (respect for going
through that). Then there's Ann Hathaway, a women who could be some kind of super
model who they are trying to sell as a scientist. Sorry guys, but if
you do such a poor job at casting, I can't take this film seriously. 3 Horrible PacingAfter the first 30-minutes the movie was dead. No emotion, no struggle.
Stupid dialogues that provoked absolutely no feelings at all.
Characters I would never care about raised trivial questions. Horrible.
The pacing of the beginning was so horrible that it destroyed
everything - how are you supposed to take a character serious who's not
even struggling to leave his family. Oh god, do they really not know
that it takes time to build a bond with the audience? 4 Good Reviews Bought? Tons of plot holes, bad pacing, poor cast,
etc... What's more, this movie fails to raise any interesting questions the
audience hasn't already asked countless times before. Where's that
ground-breaking question you could ponder over for days as was the case
with classics like 'The Matrix'? For a movie with a 8.8 rating I was
expecting some bigger questions and characters that actually get under
my skin and not this emotionless movie with a poor cast, plot holes. Now imagine the budget they had for this movie ($165,000,000) and
compare it to similar low-budget productions such as Defying Gravity
that excel at provoking emotions and still get canceled. The questions
raised in Defying Gravity were so much more interesting and the
characters so much more believable. I wouldn't shed a single tear
watching this crap. And it's not like I am some emotionless bastard. I
have cried watching shows like AMC's excellent ""Halt And Catch Fire"" or
HBO's ""Game of Thrones"", because the cast is usually outstanding and
are simply well chosen for their roles. Anne Hathaway and McConaughey
were poor choices and it shows. It shows that this was a money-grab. There will be some people who may be able to connect with the
characters. Good for them. They may not have seen many movies before
and/or are not familiar with the topic, but as a seasoned Sci-Fi fan
you will regret buying this one.

OK, I get it ! It's a Nolan movie so everyone hu-ha about it. Well
actually no, I do see lots of negative comments about this movie in the
message board. While I went in expecting a Nolan movie , I was sadly
disappointed. I got used to his style of movies which hold my attention
throughout, and can even make me watch the movie a few times. This movie is OK with its sci fi story. It does however drag many many
times and goes very slow. A lot of drama, and less science fiction. A
lot of talking and less adrenaline pumping scenes. The family drama
just doesn't ever stop. The movie is too long. Maybe if the movie was condensed from 169 minutes to just 90, it would
have been great !

This movie based on an amazing book, and was drawn into a dramatic and
hyper realistic screenplay by Spielberg before that script was
ultimately butchered into this movie by Christopher Nolan. Read the
summary of the original script - it is such a good idea for a movie.
Space sex?! How cool!What we have with Interstellar is ""crying in space"". Every character
gets at least one long crying scene. It's too much. The soundtrack is
repetitive and exhausting. The dialogue is bland, the back-story is
weak and I could go on but none of this is my real grip with
Interstellar.I think the movie is unrealistic, but not in a ""physics of space isn't
real enough"" kinda way - which is the complaint most people have when
saying this movie is unrealistic. I thought the characters were
unrealistic. I just couldn't believe that THEY believed we hadn't gone
to the moon in a day when traveling to Saturn as a species is possible.I couldn't believe that Matthew McC. would be so emotionally weak yet
be able to hack a predator drone on the fly and be an expert farmer and
an expert pilot. I couldn't believe the length that the characters
would go to in order to deceive each-other. Now for the technology - I am okay with it being a little off but the
inconsistency is what is tough to swallow. But you saw regular normal
ol' Saturn rocket boosters needed to get off of earth, yet they could
zip around near a black hole with gravity 8,000 times that of earth
with tiny little engines? They have Artificial Intelligence capable of
reliable and super-complex reasoning, with extremely strong limbs, and
they chose to give it a refrigerator for a chassis?

Just could not believe Nolan would have created this junk. I could
hardly see any action sequence and all I get to see is a family
melodrama in the name of a sci-fi movie. The plot is good, but the
movie clearly missed the direction it needed. Well the concept of space
travel, gravity, wormhole, blackhole all looks good in books, to know
more about it I would have read the brief history of time again or
watched more documents on the Theory of relativity or blackholes, but
to bring it out in reality one has to really evolve a lovely plot which
was definitely missing in this movie.If it was any other director I would have give it a 5 star. But, I have
always looked upon Nolan in the leagues of Spielberg, James Cameron or
Guy Ritchie. So, for all the great expectations and the disappointment,
all I could give is 1 star. Sorry Nolan half the theater was empty by
the time 1 hr flew and I had a take a short nap while the movie was
running at a slow pace.

Interstellar = Fascist + Simplistic + Pretentious + Predictable + Loose
+ Underdeveloped characters + Cinematic clichés + Inconsistent +
Physics gives way to mysticism + M. Night Shyamalan complex + Posits
itself as a film of many big ideas when it doesn't even possess a
single decent one + 2001 bad rip-off + Koyanisqaatsi score bad rip-off
+ Dispensable - 169 minutes of your life. Interstellar is the first
'serious' sci-fi movie I have seen that does not improve on the sight
of a blank screen viewed for the same length of time. I try to keep an
open mind and approach every movie with high hopes. It would give me
enormous satisfaction (and relief) to like this movie but this is not a
serious sci-fi movie, it's only a bad case of patchwork.

I watched Interstellar with my brother, who is as big of a science geek
as I am, and I was absolutely blown away, to say the very least. Just thinking about it, my heart is pounding again. I'm a huge fan of
epic movies that require you to actually use your brain, unlike the
cliché action movies and sappy romances they pop out every other week.
For some reason, society looks down on movies like Interstellar, and
another favorite of mine, Cloud Atlas. They're movies that make you
think. Movies you have to watch a second time to fully appreciate. And
that makes a better movie than a mediocre, predictable action movie or
what have you. Some reviews I've read are saying that the physics and scientific
phenomena of Interstellar aren't realistic, or are just plain wrong.
Such as the waves on Miller's planet, and the time anomalies. While,
yes, it is true that some of the physics were not factual, its a
science FICTION movie. Its not a space documentary. It was never meant
to be realistic in that way. With that being said, Interstellar was a masterfully crafted film. From
the beautiful, Oscar winning effects, to the Oscar worthy screen
writing and direction, to the edge-of-your-seat score by the orchestral
legend Hans Zimmer, and even the acting. Generally, Nolan's movies are
more about effects, mind effs, and awesome soundtracks. While
Interstellar had an abundance of these things, it also had phenomenal
acting. Especially the message from home scene in which Cooper erupts
into tears.It also had a few surprise actors. With Matt Damon, Casey Affleck,
Topher Grace, and John Lithgow. I still can't get over how awesome TARS and CASE are, either. My
brother and I laughed out loud over how cool they are. Namely when CASE
rescues Dr. Brand during the wave scene. The way he started spinning in
what was almost like a cartwheel was just so fluid.In conclusion, I give Interstellar a 10/10. Easily one of my favorites.
"

This movie, that's what. For the first 2.5 hours, it's easily a ten
star movie. Then it feels like Nolan had no idea how to end it, so he
kind of makes something up on the spot, but knowing that it's a load of
crap, he makes it as complicated as possible in an attempt to distract
the viewer from how awful the ending truly is. Just terrible. I feel
robbed of a good ending, and I will go to bed tonight grumpy because of
this movie.It had a chance to be one of the best movies ever made (and I do not
say that lightly), but instead it flopped harder than any movie I've
seen before. Honestly, it's how good it started that makes this so
disappointing. Thoroughly, undeniably disappointing. I mean, he really
had something here. It could have been so great.In summary, don't get your hopes up, or prepare yourself for
nonsensical tomfoolery.

It may very well be the most remarkable film I've ever seen.
Interstellar is a film which plays on your emotions more than anything
else. Many people get caught up in the plot holes and the scientific
inaccuracies, and thus, let these factors detract from what would
otherwise be an incredible cinematic experience. Interstellar is a film
to completely surrender yourself to - and let the sheer grandiosity and
emotionality move you. Forget logic, forget science. This is art in its
most fantastical and overwhelming form. A father's heart breaks as he
realizes he's broken his daughter's heart - He has left her and does
not know when he'll return. Nolan pulls every string in our heart with
the emotion of the father- daughter relationship set against the
backdrop of interstellar travel to save the human race. Interstellar
will, I feel, become more appreciated as time passes, and will, I hope,
one day be regarded as one of the greatest films ever made.

So I kinda wanted to see this, it looked good, I heard great things,
but it never looked great to me from the previews. But it stunk, hard. The science stunk, the story stunk, the plot stunk, about the only
thing that didn't suck was the casting and characters. The folks in it
did a great job, but when everything else sucks it just can't save it. I'm amazed this had such a high rating, what the heck America?!?!? Let me list just a few things that stunk: - It was WAY too long - It drug, badly, and never had any form of a climax - The science was seriously flawed. Planets with super tidal waves and
1.3g yet 1' of water, floating clouds of ice on a semi-breathable
planet, love being a 'dimension', gravity not functioning correctly on
'cooper station', etc, etc. - So, um, they sent these guys through the wormhole to check out a few
planets. Got it. It took like 90 years. Got it. When he fell back to
our solar system, he encountered a huge space station folks lived on.
Why the heck didn't they just hop through the same wormhole and land on
a beautiful planet instead of spending *massive* resources building a
space station? - The whole library thing towards the end....oh my gosh was that dumb. - The robots were also silly... I mean, they had funny personalities,
and a couple neat abilities, but were completely illogical to
construct, especially as a military item.  Did I mention it was *extremely* long, too long? Oh, and boring?  Dust takes out the human race? Really... dust??? Seal your house a
bit better, grow some plants, move underground... ugh, dust?!?!?!?  We can scan a planet from space now, but they couldn't see the mile
high tidal waves moving across the planet? No radars? No telescopes?
Didn't notice those on your flyby in the freaking space ship??? - I'm guessing the previous pilot who got fired after finding some
farmer to replace him was pretty upset. This was painful to watch, and though it has a super high rating, the
fact it only made $190M and had a budget of $165M seems to match my
feelings on it. It wasn't just me. I'm a technology nerd with far too much knowledge
about ""space stuff"", so I could dismiss that as just me. However, my
wife, an MBA sorta person, also didn't like it at all and was extremely
bored. She didn't understand the scientific inaccuracies, but the story
was too weak to support her attention. Really disappointed in it, obviously. I wouldn't recommend watching
this if you are smart unless you have absolutely nothing else to watch. I would love to see a movie that inspired humankind to look towards the
stars instead of borders on a map, as it is the only way to truly
perpetuate the species, but regardless of what I heard, this was NOT
that movie. Reasons for my #, starting at 10: -2 Scientific Inaccuracy -3 Story -2 Movie flow (boredom level) +3 Casting, acting, and relationships

Reviewer Ketzer said (and I've only read this since I came back)
""Should your cinema be graceful and insert a break, USE IT, get out,
the rest of this thing will seem to last 7 years."" and boy was he
right. Fortunately my cinema did insert a break, and while I'm home
writing this a bunch of poor souls are still suffering.I thought the tedious preamble to the film went on too long, wishing we
could get on to the interesting bits. Little did I realise that the
tedious preamble *was* the interesting bit! The ""story"" and ""characters"" were so unengaging that when (as was bound
to happen) one of them expired, I looked at the remaining ones, and
couldn't figure out who'd gone.Some people giving one star reviews have said they've done it to
balance up the over-puffed 9s and 10s. I don't. This is a 1 star film.It is abysmal. It is truly abysmal.

How to say it...? Pretentious sci-fi movie turned into easy-tear film.
No script coherence, no science coherence and not even fiction
coherence.How can anyone rate 10 points this film? How many points do they rate
Blade Runner? A thousand?And it lasts for almost 3 hours. Really? Do you need 3 hours to tell
this cheesy story?I can't believe that the same people that wrote Memento could write
this script.So, Don't waste your money, watch any other movie instead.

104,3,"
After a long drawn-out establishing sequence on our trashed home planet
Cooper and young Murph (Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy) follow a
mysterious trail to a secret NASA lab where a last ditch mission to a
wormhole to save humankind is revealed by Professor Brand (Michael
Caine) for which Cooper is implausibly selected to pilot.This section is reasonably authentic: conventional rocket stages and a
shuttle-like capsule which then docks with a larger vessel capable of
achieving artificial gravity through centrifugal force to take them on
the two year mission to Saturn. But from then on the science and the
script become increasingly fantastical; whether in the high energy
environment near Saturn, or (later) falling into a black hole our
plucky astronauts absolutely need not fear radiation. The formula for
the rocket fuel must be worth a fortune: after the initial conventional
launch the landing and taking off from large Earth sized planets is
achieved miraculously with small shuttles, so why the staged launch
vehicle was needed is a mystery. The initial two year trajectory from
Earth to Saturn and the wormhole does not then restrict the spaceship
suddenly changing course and having a quick fly round the wormhole: the
laws of celestial mechanics initially adopted are suddenly thrown out
the window! Communication (which is essential in the script to move the
plot forward) is also maintained somehow through the wormhole and back
to Earth. The three planets themselves fall into formulaic categories
of water world, ice planet, and (at the end) desert planet, and whilst
some have oxygen whether there are plants or living organisms producing
the oxygen is not made clear. The sexy black hole Gargantua gets lots
of attention, but the star(s) at the heart of the system are forgotten
about.Despite data from earlier probes dispatched through the wormhole the
astronauts seem to know next to nothing about the planetary conditions
(again essential for the script) but somehow arrive exactly where the
early expeditions landed (or crashed). It seems the script is as twisty
as the wormhole! Throughout this movie there is absolutely no sense of
any rudimentary astronomical comprehension and so despite the painfully
thin gloss of authenticity we are basically in Star Trek space fantasy
land: anyone seeing this movie expecting verisimilitude will feel they
have been very cleverly conned.The derivative concept boils down to one part 2001 A Space Odyssey to
one part Contact with a liberal dollop of Gravity (space docking /
disasters etc). The art design is in itself curious: the clunky robots
seem to be wilfully jointed variants of the monoliths from 2001, the
cheap and nasty space suits (intentionally?) retro NASA, the
hibernation pods that sink dramatically into the floor (why?) part 2001
part Alien. Overlaying the woefully dodgy science is a powered-up
emotion plot line that at times is intensely annoying and hugely
implausible: for example when one of the astronauts drowns on the water
world all the attention is on Cooper missing his family; their dead
colleague with whom they have been cooped up in the spaceship for years
is immediately forgotten, and when they return to the mother ship the
fact the remaining astronaut has been waiting for 20 years gets little
plot attention: more wormholes in the aim-to-crowd-please script? This
mid-film emphasis on Cooper and his family is massively self indulgent
and McConaughey's character becomes very irritating. .Throughout Hans Zimmer's score provides a high decibel level of aural
dampening to divert the brain from these trivial inconsistencies or
when the plot or painful dialogue starts to sag; whilst Brand (Anne
Hathaway) provides cute. Those parts of the script that are discernible
through the thundering score are lightweight, tedious, and overworked.So what do we learn if we retrospectively compare the three movies:
2001, Contact, and Interstellar: in hindsight 2001 can now be seen to
represent a triumph of direction and cinematography, thoughtful
intelligent script, a sound science base bound together in beauty and
imagination; in contrast Contact it seems is already exhibiting the
growth of emo in science fiction movies (epitomised by the self
indulgence offered its star Jodie Foster), though this is contained
within a reasonably plausible and scientifically based script, but oh
dear when we look at Interstellar doesn't this movie says something
rather awful about the sloppy crowd pleasing filmic times we live in,
with the massed forces of technical wizardry and editing coupled with
that all pervasive score to dull our dissent. Stanley Kubrick can rest
easy; despite the hype Interstellar is not going to knock 2001 of its
stellar perch. Overblown, over-hyped, corny, unscientific, implausible,
Interstellar fails majestically as great cinema. Meanwhile 2001 like
the very best sci-fi is subversive, it has edge - even satire, it
transcends genres, it asks us the audience to think, and it exposes the
brutality of the human condition. Where it is optimistic this optimism
is undercut ambiguously, and it has profound things to say about
humankind's place in the universe. Interstellar meanwhile, whilst for
sure its sugary effect lingers cloyingly in the brain after leaving the
cinema, is a mere annoying dust mote in the eye of space cinema.

Somewhere in Interstellar is a decent 90 minute movie padded to 3
hours. I thought it might feel long; what I didn't expect was the
cheap, weepy emoting and Hallmark philosophizing.As for the padding, at least 40 minutes goes by before anyone mentions
space, yet nothing of the ecological disaster is explained in any
depth. No point is so trivial it can't be made ten times, no scene so
long it can't be stretched beyond the breaking point. And oh, the sap 
love is described as a kind of quantum effect that transcends time and
space (as long as it's between parent and child).The supposed scientific accuracy was limited largely to the depiction
of stellar lensing around the black hole and the silence of space.
Howevvver - Why do pickup trucks look exactly the same in the future? Why is the
dust all over the trucks and house but not the crops? - That was the most ridiculous robot I've ever seen (I love the comment
that it was made of ""spinning HVAC ducts""). How does this lurching
refrigerator even get itself through a hatch? Its interface is a crude
text screen worthy of a PCjr, yet it has a complete human personality
(so much so that I had a hard time distinguishing its voice from the
crew).- Do you always launch your rockets from the middle of your office
buildings? Remarkable how those glass partitions in view stood up to
the blast.- Apparently having no idea of what a wormhole is BEFORE being sent
through one, Matthew is shown the rudimentary folded paper analogy.
Wouldn't that have come up on the first day of class? - How does a mile-high wave form out of foot-deep water? - The planet orbits a black hole? Where's your light and heat coming
from? Any problem with the intense X-rays usually found around these
things? Guess not.- On Matt Damon's planet, exactly why aren't the ""frozen clouds""
falling? At least Avatar posited superconducting rocks and intense
magnetic fields to explain their floating mountains.- When Matt takes Matthew out to show him the ""surface"", just how far
do they walk? The rescue pilot flies at hundreds of miles an hour for
at least a few minutes.- When Cooper returns to our solar system, at least 60 years has
elapsed since he received his daughter's video messages (since she is
now in her 90s or more), so has Anne Hathaway been alone all that time
on her planet? I don't recall any mention that she was going to be in a
slow time region. By the way, time only slows down significantly in a
very high gravitational field, which they showed no signs of being in.Besides all that and much more, the plot was disjointed, with
inarticulate dialog and confusing placement of people. For example,
during the entire scene of the boosted entry towards the black hole, I
didn't know Cooper was in the shuttle, separated from Anne Hathaway in
the station, until he looked across at her.It's not a completely terrible movie, there are some great visuals that
are impressive in IMAX. But they're dragged down with the padding and
cheap sentiment.

The film is spectacular and starts off really nice and promises to be
very interesting. But once the spaceship leaves the ground, the movie
deteriorates rapidly, and as it progresses it becomes so unbelievable
and ludicrous, that I left the theater quite annoyed and very
disappointed. I didn't like most of the characters. They are clichés,
and none made me sympathetic to their cause or character. The robot is
also extremely familiar and it's design is ludicrous, trying to be both
advanced and ancient at the same time. I really likes other films by
the Nolan brothers, but it seems they don't give their scripts as much
attention as they used to. A disappointment.
"

I went to watch this movie expecting it might be a decent sci-fi movie
but it turned out to be yet another terrible crap. Here are the few
reasons why I found it crap.1. If a guy fell in a typhoon (a usual Earth disaster), it is most
probable he will die, but Mr. Coop is made of some different material.
The guy went inside a black hole (where matter collapse beyond nuclear
and quark level) but he comes out in one piece with all his
consciousness intact. This very presentation by Nolan just cheapened
the depiction of a black hole.2. So top notch team was sent out by NASA, yet they cry and whine about
so small issues like ""oh, I want to see my daughter back"". Even at my
company of 16 people we act more professionally.Seriously people buy whatever crap is fed to them in the name of Nolan.

Looks great, but is filled with sappy dialog, daft twists and silly
science.Don't get me wrong, you should see this film for its look alone.Just don't fall into the trap of thinking this is somehow going to
change your life.There are no proved wormholes in the real world.The whole plot is filed with this hole and that's what undermines it.This is the over-hyped sci-fi film with a twist ending that M. Night
Shyamalan didn't direct.Maybe if he had, people would see it for what it is.

There are moments during ""Interstellar"" which may be compared to ""2001:
A Space Odyssey"" (a better movie). There are moments during
""Interstellar"" which may be compared to ""Prometheus"" (also, a better
movie). There are even moments and storytelling techniques within
""Interstellar"" that are completely ripped off from ""Inception"" (a much
better movie, from Christopher Nolan himself). That said,
""Interstellar"" should still be touted as the most ambitious film of the
year so far, and in the same breath, should ultimately go down as one
of director Christopher Nolan's worst films to date.This highly anticipated Nolan project depicts a future riddled with
dust storms, where the world's food supply is nearly depleted (or at
least 40 to 60 years out from being depleted, but that doesn't sound
nearly as dire) where astronauts are working as farmers and children
are taught that the Apollo space missions were faked. During this time,
an underground government institution called NASA commissions a group
of astronauts (including Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway) for a
top secret space mission. This mission will have them traveling through
a newly discovered wormhole, with the promise of finding another
inhabitable world.OK, let's get right to it. Any praise I heap upon this movie will be
directed at the final 90 minutes of this two hour and 49 minute long
film, since the first 80 or so minutes of ""Interstellar"" (while
absolutely gorgeous at times to behold) is drenched in sequences of
McConaughey seemingly reenacting moments from those pretentious Lincoln
car ads, caught in a continuous and almost finger wagging diatribe
about how the human race was never meant to die on earth, which nearly
put me to sleep. In other words, the first half of this is as slow and
lifeless as watching a dead astronaut drift through space. Anyway, this
is Intersellar's fatal flaw, since the latter half is ripe with big
budget yet very symbolic action sequences, stunning cinematography and
fascinating talking points dealing with the nature of human survival in
the face of an unsympathetic universe, due to some really insightful
slabs of dialogue from a script written by Nolan and his brother,
Jonathan. Even the literal rocket science lingo becomes more and more
palatable as the ""gravity"" of this plot begins to set in, near the
midpoint of Act 2.Final Thought/The Ending: Allow me to take a quick spoiler free moment
to discuss this ending. During the final act of ""Interstellar"", for
most film nerds, Nolan's story will be encroaching on the hallowed
grounds of Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Some will admire the
sheer ballsyness of what he does in this pivotal moment and others will
find it in bad taste. Though this is not a huge issue, since I don't
believe this niche group will have much effect on ticket sales, the
problem is that for the millions who didn't see ""Interstellar"" for any
film school aesthetic reason, Nolan's ending will simply come off as so
strange and obnoxiously far-fetched, that many may leave the theater
angry that the punch-line wasn't worth the nearly three hour set up.

""Interstellar"" was an above average film and I have no regrets spending
a Friday night checking it out. Unsophisticated audiences may enjoy it
if they don't analyze it too deeply. However, if you are one who
understands the world of physics, aviation, or space travel, this one
is hard to watch. There are a plethora of continuity issues as well as
plot holes. It seems like Chris Nolan watched ""Gravity"" and decided he
could make a really terrible film into something worth watching. He
added the ""Contact"" premise and inserted some Physics theories and some
expanded back story to create a mediocre film. I was hopeful that I
would be impressed by the obviously inflated reviews but I wasn't. The
guy next to me actually fell asleep during the first hour which was
very grueling. Of our group, there were three thumbs down and one
thumbs up.

I had high expectations for this film by Chris Nolan. ""Inception"" was
ground breaking, you could definitely say it had never been 'done
before' or seen that before! The pre release hype was strong for
Interstellar and I really enjoy SF movies, so pass the popcorn!SPOILERS: Firstly character wise...There is zero chemistry between
Cooper and Dr. Brand! Yet in the end, we're being told/shown that there
is/will be? Really? Then Dr. Mann, he was asleep for years and when they wake him, they
don't verify his claims? And his mental status? Why was he sent on this
mission in the first place? And he easily removes the communication
device from Cooper's helmet, and so on. Really cheesy and poorly
written. Then he escapes in the craft to get to the Endurance, hello?
No security protocols? It is so unbelievable.Time flashbacks...Cooper can revisit time, so why not pick a time he
can really affect? Maybe further back and even help to prevent the
natural environmental breakdowns that Earth is experiencing in this
story.Robots...black monoliths...hello where have I seen that before? Is this
the shape that a space exploration robot would be designed as? This was
so silly I couldn't stop laughing!Fuel: They have a limited supply! OMG! Ever hear of nuclear power like
in a submarine, etc? Also I would expect them to have perfected nuclear
fusion or such to provide unlimited (almost) power. But no, they use
chemical rockets (technology from the 1940's). This was so poorly
written.Let's not forget 'Waterworld' even, when they land on the water planet.
Gee, maybe a survey/probe first would be in order? And then the other
planet, looked a lot like the ice world in the 'Star Trek' movie a few
years ago where Jim Kirk is exiled to and meets Spock.And the most bizarre of all? He gets coordinates of a TOP SECRET base
and he's just the person they want to fly the spacecraft? And no one
else could find this base? Did the workers there need food from local
providers? Anyways, you get my point, it is so disjointed and when you watch it,
it is a melange of many previous movies, hence Heinz 57 varieties. It
carries bits of '2001 A Space Odyssey' (and its sequels also) which is
a natural one to look to. Then 'Contact' and many more...truly picking
experiences from a bevy of SF movies and mixing them. At least they
didn't have thruster sounds in space! (no sound in space, remember
'Aliens'? No one will hear you scream!) Is this the best that Chris Nolan and Hollywood can come up with? No
original screenwriter/story out there? My final measurement of a film is will I buy the Blu-ray disc when it
comes out? Nope, not for this extremely long and drawn out film. I
might buy it in the cheapo bin for $3.99 in a few years time and watch
it just for the extras/deleted scenes and then put it on the shelf to
gather dust.So just like in the movie, I was hoping for a worm hole to get to the
end of this long drawn out tedium...but unfortunately for me, time was
actually going to be moving much longer than normal time and I've lost
3 hours of my life I'll never get back. So terribly disjointed with
decent actors trying to save it.Unless you are starving for a SF movie, avoid this like a bad worm hole
and keep your feet planted on terra firma. Folks, this is a really
terrible movie and I would avoid it and save your money for something
else.

A simple farm guy named Copper (Matthew McConaughey) and a few other
experts go into outer space to explore other worlds that might sustain
human life. It seems that that life on Earth might not survive due to
to some unexplained environmental disaster. Naturally nothing goes
right.WAY overpraised and terrible sci-fi movie. When I heard the plot from
this I expected the worst. Writer/director Christopher Nolan has never
been a favorite for me--I HATE what he did to Batman in his movie
trilogy. I thought that he as trying to imitate Stanley Kubrick
(""2001"") here but it's far worse--he's doing Steven Spielberg! The
movie runs WAY too long (165 minutes) and they're constantly pushing
family friendly values in your face. Cooper's non-stop yammering about
his daughter got on my nerves instantly. Also that stupid fake southern
accent he adopts is immediately annoying. The story is very slow and
all the characters are cardboard cutouts you've seen in other movies.
The special effects are flawless and there's some beautiful
cinematography here but the extreme length and boring story really
weigh it down. Any sort of statement they're trying to make on time and
life is completely deadened by the script. Also this movie is very
manipulative and way too sentimental. They go out of their way to make
the audience cry--like at a Spielberg movie. Well I did cry--tears of
joy at the end that this was over! Also the gaps in logic and plot
holes here are very annoying. I lost track of how many times I rolled
my eyes at the dubious ""logic"" served up here. The acting was as good
as it could be (I guess) but, at the end, they throw in a surprise
guest star (who I won't name). It didn't help because I think he's a
terrible actor and this didn't change my mind. I was bored and looked
at my watch MANY times while this played. It's boring, obvious and
manipulative. Why is this getting so much praise? Skip it.

Even the title Interstellar evokes greatness, and the movie express
this greatness through terrific photography supported by great picture
quality (go to IMAX 70mm) and definitely communicated by soundtrack.
Nolan knows that when you have Hans Zimmer on board you have an
insurance: with his music you can transform even your dog daily service
in an epic movie. Moreover the movie has a wonderful editing which give
a great pace to the story. 9/10 on everything up to now. But when it
comes down to the plot we barely reach 6/10. I will never understand
why those Hollywood mega-productions that can do everything and have
all these great subjects cannot avoid to make trivial mistakes across
the plot. While looking at the movie it is like realizing that some
good person had great ideas starting from the subject following with
great details like the dust, the robots, the hibernation beds, and then
somebody comes and place here and there some very simple mistakes. Here
some:First of all,the whole thing does not add up: the first time Cooper
leave earth, who sent him the NASA coordinate?? NON SENSE.second, at the starting of the movie you know the ending because too
much emphasis has been placed on the message 'STAY'. I understand it
adds a lot of drama to the departure scene but really spoils the
ending. From there on you are only curious on how he will communicate
back, which became clearer while watching the rest of the movie.Third, I loved the transition between the departure from home with the
truck and the rocket launch BUT wait a moment. Three stages Saturn V
rocket to reach the Earth orbit (..OK they were using spares from
Apollo mission..OK..) and in all the rest of the movie these guys land
and launch from 3 different earth-like planets by using simply the
small spacecraft??? C'mon. Fourth, OK, you are trapped and the only person who can save humanity
by communicating through time and what is the first thing you send to
your daughter? Of course binary coded coordinates of NASA
installation!! Not your name, not her name, but coordinates of the NASA
launch site, so that the younger-yourself can LEAVE!If only all that
you want is for him to STAY which is what you will send immediately
after. OK maybe he do not know that he, him self, will start the whole
thing just by following those coordinates..:/ WTF!!why?? Guys, I can
understand you need to send Cooper to NASA, but couldn't you find
something else?Fifth. This is minor, but really annoys me that in 2014, in the
Interstellar production, you, screenwriters team, need AGAIN to make
someone to slide and fall and trap her leg to create AGAIN the
run-for-it-but-I-cant scene, on a planet in which every minute is a
year wasted in the search for humanity salvation and to bring back some
unknown data!? C'MON! You guys, have the best technicians and movie artisans, can afford
almost everything you like, then again, why you have to slide on the
banana peel? I will never understand.

Like all Christopher Nolan films, it has a very interesting premise and
introduction. Like most of them, it doesn't live up to it until the
end. But, this one actually falls apart harder and uglier than most.It's not just that the science(-fiction) falls apart. The story, the
acting, the everything falls apart and leaves a very ""what the hell
just happened"" feel to it.I think that Mat Damon's part, which is great and he should play more
such roles, actually serves as a divider. After that, it's like looking
at a different movie and things might have been better if it just ended
around that time.It has many good stuff in there, so it's worth your time, but, it does
leave a lot to be desired.

After leaving the theater with a bad taste having just watched The
Martian, I finally looked at the reviews and found some expressing the
same disappointment with the movie but also highly recommending
Interstellar. So I watched Interstellar on DVD. The sci-fi ambiance of
Interstellar is more to my liking than The Martian's which is ruined by
overuse of disco and Bowie. While I liked Interstellar in general, I
found it very uneven. Cooper is heroic and idealistic but at times
almost hysterical with unexpected emotional outbursts. Brand is an
accomplished scientist but in the end admits she picks Edmund's planet
for no reason other than love. And then there is Romilly who I think
suffered the most for the longest time out of all the major characters.
And yet there's hardly any exploration or recognition of what he did
during those 23 years that he waited alone, only to be killed by, yes,
The Martian himself.

Where to start....This movie is so over the top weird that it ends up
making so sense. It's so all over the place, so over acted, so dumb, so
poorly acted and so boring that it's just a pure all around bad movie.
Matthew McConaughey poorly acts the same boring, hick character he
plays in every movie he was ever in (similar to nick cage). The plot is
just lame and way to retarded to follow or even attempt to make
realistic or interesting. Apparently getting sucked into a black hole
sends you to some library of time... I wont say anymore than that
because it gets even stupider. Just a bad bad bad movie. There will be
only one Kubrick...and its not you mr.Nolan!

Christopher Nolan's next masterpiece. From the amazing practical
effects and the wonderfully emotional sound score created from Hans
zimmer and to a story that could have only been created by Christopher
Nolan this film will blow you away. (high IQ recommended) A movie that will leave you feeling so small and helpless but at the
same time so capable and empowered to change, I wont dive too deep into
the storyline and i will just let that experience be a truly
intellectual and thought provoking journeyMatthew McConaughey is at the top of his game in this film bringing the
character of ""Cooper"" to an emotional level that you wouldn't expect
from McConaughey and at the same time he excels putting his name in
there with the best in business todayThis is truly a movie worth watching for those who love to view movies
that created with an intellectual context a movie that will definitely
leave you satisfied 10/10

There were a lot of quality films released in 2014 and, while it may
not be #1, INTERSTELLAR is the most mind-blowing. As much as I loved
Christopher Nolan's Batman series, I'm even more excited to see him
return to his own devices. The man's got vision and I love seeing it
brought to screen, and INTERSTELLAR is his jump into the world of
science fiction (for the record, INCEPTION was more action/fantasy than
sci-fi). This is an awe- inspiring tale of mankind's last desperate
attempt to save itself from extinction. In the not-too-distant future,
the world's crops have fallen victim to a new blight and food is
becoming scarce. The dying crops have left the soil barren and the
nation has fallen into a new era of immense dust storms. Bizarre
anomalies in his daughter's bedroom lead former experimental pilot
Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) to a secret base containing all that
remains of the NASA space program. We discover that NASA, led by
Cooper's former colleague Professor Brand (Michael Caine) and his
daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway), has begun an operation to try and save
what is left of humanity. A wormhole appeared in the vicinity of Saturn
almost fifty years ago that links our solar system to a galaxy
elsewhere in the universe, and a group of astronauts were sent through
ten years ago to scope out potential habitable worlds for relocation.
Now it's time to see what they found. The mission: Cooper and Amelia
will lead an expedition through the wormhole to investigate the planets
where astronauts are broadcasting positive signals, while Professor
Brand will remain on Earth attempting to solve the problem of how to
subjugate gravitational forces to the point where a station containing
humanity's remnants could be launched from the surface of the Earth.Now that his Batman series is down and gone director Christopher Nolan
can focus on original material, and I'm thankful for that. I can
honestly say I've never been disappointed by the man, and now he's
entered one of my favorite genres with the science fiction epic
INTERSTELLAR. I love that we're seeing a new trend of ""realistic"" films
on space exploration and Nolan has created one of the most ambitious
yet. He and his brother Jonathan have done their research and, just in
case it's not enough, they had acclaimed physicist Kip Thorne on hand
as a consultant on the film's science. The result is a movie that isin
my personal opinionintriguing beyond words. The film posits what it
would be like to travel through a wormhole and reminds us that the
concept of time is not as cut-and-dry as the average person tends to
believe. Travelling at insanely high speeds or close proximity to
enormous gravitational sources affect the relative passage of time, and
this concept is used in INTERSTELLAR as the film's ""ticking clock"". On
their adventure across the cosmos, time is moving at a slower rate for
Cooper and his team and minutes wasted on their expedition could equate
to years lost on Earth. This is one of the most interesting elements of
space travel that rarely, if ever, has been portrayed in mainstream
film. It makes for a fantastic new challenge in watching this team of
scientists, light years away from home, try to accomplish their goal
before their mission fails purely because the human race has gone
extinct in the time it took them to do it. But, as much as I loved the
use of real science in the film, INTERSTELLAR is guilty of some
schmaltz in the final act that weakens it.As much as I hate the idea of love being an actual force of the
universe, I'm willing to accept it in the world of the film because the
cast almost, sort of sells it. Nolan scores another phenomenal cast,
pulling a few from previous projects and bringing on some new faces.
Matthew McConaughey is in top form as the film's hero, Cooper. A former
test pilot, he's called upon by NASA to pilot the craft for this
expedition. In doing so, he's forced to leave his two children behind
with hopes that he can accomplish the mission and give them a future.
The scene where Cooper confronts his daughter with the reality that he
will most likely be gone for many years is probably the most powerful
in the movie. Not going to lie, that's the part that forms the lump in
my throat every time. After films like KILLER JOE and DALLAS BUYERS
CLUB, McConaughey has sold himself as one of the top modern performers.
The man has range and I hate that he wasted his talent for years before
emerging as a powerhouse. Anne Hathaway does fine as Amelia Brand but
he's pretty unlikeable until later in the movie. She's got noble
intentions but her attitude problem and self-serving nature don't serve
her well. No worries though; she has her redemption. Jessica Chastain
is the third major role in the film as Cooper's daughter Murphy in her
adult years. Chastain has an equally meaty role with Murphy having
grown into a woman that never quite forgave her father for leaving but
continued to work with Professor Brand on his gravity problem. Outside
of our main three, the supporting cast (while impressive John Lithgow,
Casey Affleck, etc.) is mostly filler. INTERSTELLAR primarily rests on
the shoulders of McConaughey, Chastain, and Hathaway (all right, and a
pair of fun robots) and they seem more than capable of caring us
through.INTERSTELLAR takes a lot of hits for its climax, which I'll admit is
the film's major weakness, but I really enjoy it as a whole. I never
feel the expansive running time and, in fact, I'm usually eager to
watch it again soon after it's finished. Good science fiction that
doesn't rely on laser battles or bizarre alien monsters isn't easy to
come by, so Nolan's film is a welcome breath of fresh air to the genre
for me.
"

2001, anyone? That brilliant piece of filmmaking that challenged us to
do something that mainstream Hollywood has long since shelved: Think.
Use your wonderful brains, people! Remember that films don't have to be
simply a means to an end; they can push past our own intellectual
limitations, establish beautifully thought-provoking horizons just
beyond our reach, and best of all, can be memorable not for what they
say, but for what they do. It physically pains me to see promising
filmmakers with the appropriate intellectual boundlessness to follow in
Kubrick's footsteps pushed to the side in favour of bland individuals
with little more than visuals and violence in their creative arsenal.
Admittedly, I enjoy my CGI extravaganzas as much as the next guy, and
that is why Interstellar is a six-and-a-half-star film in my book. As
far as visuals go, it's really, well, stellar. But it is simply too
unsatisfying and draws too many parallels with 2001 (without delivering
on them) to be considered as anything more.Here's the rundown: Earth is dying. Sandstorms are consuming the world
(Mad Max prequel?). Humanity is losing hope. It's all very bleak, but
concepts often are. In fact, as far as original settings go, it's
rather stirring. The settings in most pre-apocalyptic films are already
basically destroyed, but in Interstellar, the bleak atmosphere of
impending destruction is done rather well. It invoked within me a
surprisingly genuine lack of hope. But this is mostly owing to the fact
that this segment of the film was shot in rural Alberta, which is
pretty close to where I live, so I was able to recognize the
deterioration of the landscape, having been there many times in my
childhood.Matthew Mcconaughey stars as Cooper, a retired pilot working on the
farm with his son, daughter, and dad. I've always found Mcconaughey's
performances to be rather cloying, since the first film I saw him in
was Mud and he fit so perfectly into the role that I can't exactly see
him doing anything else. Coop's daughter, Murph, finds extraterrestrial
messages that send them off to the secret NASA headquarters, which are
surprisingly close to their house. Coop meets the head of NASA (Michael
Caine) and his daughter (Anne Hathaway). He is then offered the
opportunity to leave Earth to find a new home for humanity, which he
reluctantly accepts (to the selfish ire of Murph).When the space scenes are actually in space (Saturn, the wormhole, and
the black hole), they are undeniably breathtaking. There is a
particularly beautiful shot in which the spaceship, little more than a
speck in the distance, silently glides past Saturn, kindling a sense of
the emptiness, loneliness, and most importantly, sheer vastness of
space. But once we step inside the ship, the story and narrative begin
to lose their momentum as the actors discuss love, nature, and all
sorts of misguided ideas with all the intelligence of, well, actors.
The scientific discussions are sort of engaging, but the film would
have succeeded just as well had science been left undisturbed.Since we're on the topic of science, let me say this: I don't
understand why people revel in Interstellar's scientific accuracy.
Films are not textbooks, and if you think they are, you'd probably be
better off reading a textbook. You might as well go after The Matrix
for being an affront to the laws of physics. And the science in
Interstellar is basic stuff. It's thin, easily understood, and easily
applied. Notice 2001 had no science. There were no explanations,
scientific discussions, nothing. But the question remains: did we need
them? Of course not.Anyway, back to Interstellar. After they go through the wormhole (which
was put there by unknown sentient beings), they arrive at a solar
system orbiting a black hole which has three promising planets. Black
holes mess with time, and that concept is played with rather
effectively, except for the fact that it turns Murph into an annoyed,
peevish Jessica Chastain who takes up too much screen time.And then one of the single most viscous and ridiculous monologues about
love takes place. It would have been fine, had Nolan realized that love
and science don't mix, and when they do, it just sounds ridiculous. But
it happens, and its saccharine sentimentality induces cringes of a
ridiculous magnitude. Your reaction to this scene (and perhaps the
whole film) is a testimony to your cynicism. Needless to say, this
scene made me feel like dung, and when Matt Damon's character sees it
fit to do the same thing, I felt even worse. The script is long-winded
and pretentious, saying too much when saying less would have a greater
effect.However, the docking scene is excellent, a visual marvel among visual
marvels, a raucous nod to 2001 that forcefully pushes past Kubrick's
weightless spaceship ballet into something that is stunningly intense,
but stunningly serene as well.Interstellar's climax is extremely disappointing, a strange mix-up
between 2001 and Deus Ex Machina that has the audacity to present
itself as profound. Given the buildup of the hopeless ""no escape""
feeling generated by the first bit of the film, the ending is a blatant
narrative cop-out that was hastily strung in when the Nolans realized
that they already had way too many pages and had to figure out a way to
end it, and fast. Which they do, and the audience is greatly the worse
for it.Interstellar is a film trapped by the impossibility of its own concept
to find itself at a happy ending, its blandly scripted and acted
characters, and its desire to be something more, without having the
intellectual horsepower and narrative creativity to do so. Perhaps if
Interstellar slimmed itself down by discarding its plot, characters,
and dialogue, it could have been a fantastic theoretical documentary
that swept us into a stunning unknown.

There are few films that not only astonish with the detailed and
professional work done throughout whole movie, from the very first
scene to the very last one, but also inspires to learn and learn
everyday. You know if my teacher of physics firstly showed me this and
said that ""This is all physics"" may be that could have changed my whole
life. This is not just a fantasy-action movie with the guys with
special equipment and the universe, this is science, that inspires and
pushes forward the generations. Huge thank you to every contributor!
Thanks to the people who sacrifice their whole time and energy to make
something that inspires truly, something that makes our brain worms to
move. This somehow changed the way I think, therefore the way I will
act.

Being a movie by Christoper Nolan you can expect a movie to be long and
dull paced. And he would never endorse 3D. Still his Inception movie
was visually stunning and appealing inspite of not having the 3D.Coming to this movie, this could have been improved a lot in terms of
visual effects and could have implemented 3D. But since it is a movie
with long duration it is good that this one was without 3D. What makes you sit through entire movie is story that gets interesting
with each minute. You will have cope with certain Physics mumbo-jumbo
terms which would be difficult to concentrate on and would wish you
remote control in theater seek back and forth. The recent best ""space"" themed movie was Gravity and if its still
playing in your town watch that instead of this. Though the story
concept is different you would be better off watching that than this
one. This movie was watchable and enjoyable but I feel it won't be
worth for what you pay for.
"
123,6,"
Why this movie is called Interstellar is beyond me. They talk so much
about gravity, that it should simply be called Gravity: No, Not that
One and get it over with. On a more serious note, this is an alright
movie. It's not the new 2001, that's for sure. One of the major
problems of this movie is the uneven segments, and a plot scattered all
around. I honestly liked the middle part the best, when they starts
explaining the original space project till the point when they get to
the first planet. The first part of the movie for me felt a bit long,
dragged out, and as soon as the daughter started talking about someone
communicating through her bookshelf, I guessed the twist. Yes, there is
a twist. One that you see coming after twenty minutes into the movie.
And then comes the third part, which in my opinion is just a mess.
Surely, it had been thought out before as it has to connect to
everything previously seen. But, it feels like it had been written two
hours before the filming started. It never seems to end, it just goes
on, with more scenes, and more shots from the side of the spaceship.
And then there is that Matt Damon segment. Why is that in the movie and
what purpose does it serve? His character lost it, we get it, but why
put that distraction from the main plot in an already long movie? And
then, of course, there is the science part of this science fiction.
Don't bother. It's interesting, no doubt, but mostly it's wrong. For
people wanting this to be the new 2001, it's just not happening. Not
that this movie is that bad, it's just not that good. And for those who
compare this movie to Gravity, they are not really similar. Yes, both
movies feature space and a protagonist that goes to great lengths to
get home. But, Gravity is more concentrated on visuals, nothing wrong
with that, and it's a survival movie. Interstellar is space exploration
mixed with some action and some philosophy movie. As far as the special
effects go, scene where they travel through the void is amazing and
thrilling. Even without 3D. That's by the way what I liked about this
movie. It didn't force 3D on us. Although there were some scenes that
deserved it. The music was effective in most of the scenes, although
there were a couple of moments that should have remained without
soundtrack. I don't need music to tell me when to feel sad about the
characters. And yes, the robots were cool. I kind of felt bad for this
movie. It had potential, but it failed at some crucial points that
damaged it beyond repair. The characters have little development,
although I did find the relationship between the protagonist and his
daughter emotional and realistic. They really work well together. And
that made me realize that Nolan has shown a little improvement in
emotional colouring of the characters. Even they don't change much of
their temperaments throughout the movie. There are two twists in this
movie, in my opinion. The first one involves Michael Caine's character,
and the second one is the actual, major one. However, I found both of
those out of place. Especially Michael Caine's one. Anne Hathaway was
decent in this movie, but the supporting cast was weak. You could tell
that they were there just to die at some point in the movie, one after
another. Again, it had potentials, but it wasn't enough. It could have
been at least a half an hour shorter. For me, it's just another Nolan
movie that I'm used to seeing. I'm not Nolan's fan, but I'm not
disliking his movies that much. He's just not that impressive to me.
He'll always be creative and have interesting stories to tell, but when
it comes to putting that into work, it doesn't work entirely.
"
124,10,"
The movie was a masterpiece. The acting with stunning scenes and
awesome soundtrack brought this film to my knees. The crew worked
together with 0 ego and instead brought the best of the story to life.
It was't hard to understand the scientific theories and was explained
in a way that didn't't have a narrator trying to make the audience make
sense of the movie. The movie made sense without pause and to me that
is original and genius and was not easy to do. To the people giving the
movie 1 stars you are obviously full of yourselves and can't make an
analytical review. Overall the movie got a big hit at the box office
and in a way these bad reviews are pointless than the expressions of
people's opinions. Making a negative one about an original and
spectacular movies is just not good sport and unprofessional,
especially with no plausible reason as to what made it a non watchable
movie.
"
125,10,"
The movie was an obvious 10/10, It was so good that now it's probably
one of my favorite movies of all time. I got extra hyped for the movie
knowing that Christoper Nolan was the director, because I love his work
with the dark knight trilogy and Inception.Now before saying anything else I would just like to point out that I
am a manly man with a beard and I don't often cry to movies and such
but this movie really got to me. I basically had to punch a concrete
wall and eat dirt just to get my manliness back after the movie was
done.There were some plot holes in the movie but nothing that gave me a
feeling that the movie was bad or something like that.So too summarize i'll just say this for anyone who hasn't seen this
movie yet please just do it, I really recommend you watching it because
it was so good and in same time emotional.
"
126,6,"
This is an interesting film but my appreciation of it was ruined by the
dreadful soundtrack with all the mumbled dialogue of the characters,
Cooper being the worst with a couple of others close behind. With the
size of the budget I do not know why they didn't use better
microphones.Surely one of the main aims of any film is not to leave anyone
wondering what they're saying to each other. Clarity of speech does not
appear to be a modern requirement in the film world. I'm afraid I soon
loose interest if I can't follow the dialogue & mine went after 30
minutes of dusty farming......

It was very interesting he has a lot of emotion and drama And expect it
to be this movie one of the best drama movies.but No GG nomination for the McConaissance?!?! Bullshit! I was so sure
he could be a back-to-back Oscar winner! That scene of him balls-out
bawling while watching backlogs of Tom's video messages is just so...I
don't even know! Our facial expressions are so heavily influenced by
how we THINK we should look based on emotional representations in
visual media. Is this how people look when they're experiencing
emotions? Even if not, I just wanna look like Matthew McConaughey all
the time!""Interstellar"" is the only Christopher Nolan movie I've liked since
""Memento."" This sprawling space and time saga is set in the nearly
apocalyptic future where food is scarce, farming is an essential though
still blue-collar career, NASA has become SNASA (Secret NASA), and the
smoonlanding (secret moonlanding) is thought to have been faked. Cooper
is an aeronautical pilot tapped for a dangerous mission of indefinite
duration to find new life- sustaining planets. His young daughter never
quite forgives him for leaving, and his quest is one of survival and
return. I especially love the scene of Coop driving away in a cloud of dust,
underscored by the space shuttle countdown. Mackenzie Foy as young
Murph is sweet and teary, and Jessica Chastain deftly takes her into
adulthood as a tough yet tender space crusader. Surprise Matt Damon
(the best kind of Matt Damon) is tender and menacing as the ""destroyer
of worlds"" - a recurring motif that I enjoy in Nolan's work. The movie has its nonsensical flaws, of course. Wes Bentley's character
is killed off way to quickly and anticlimactically because emotional
plot point. The one equation to save humanity is a mere deus ex machina
McGuffin. It's not explained in any plausible, scientific manner; we
just have to roll with it. And dat Anne Hathaway doe. So
melt-your-face-off- brilliant in ""Les Miserables,"" yet so full of
nothing in this. Dr. Brand has gumption written into her, but Hathaway
can't infuse enough life into a character with no compelling purpose or
motivation beyond
blah-blah-save-the-human-race-blah-blah-love-conquers-all.
"
128,6,"
I thought this film was very watchable and entertaining. At times it's
brilliant but at other times it's cringeworthy. Some of the dialogue
and forced conversations were straight out of a B Movie. What really
bothered me though is that there are some extremely technical
conversations that make no sense to the average person and they go on
for 5 minutes. At other times there is no explanation for what is
happening and I sat there frowning and wondering what was going on. But
then some of the obvious plot points were massively over-explained. And
then there's the glaring plot holes. Matthew Mcconaughey finds a secret
NASA base near his house and when they find out he used to be a space
pilot they ask him to fly their new mission for them. So a day later
he's on his way into space after a quick ""see ya kids"". This gave the
screenwriter the opportunity to use him as the dumbo who constantly
asks his crew mates what's going on. I mean, how on earth did a trained
NASA pilot not know anything about black holes or wormholes? Don't even
get me started on the bit where Matt Damon showed up. Overall this has
some magnificent special effects, a few great moments of tension and
emotion and some smart plot twists. But because it's all played out so
seriously it makes the glaring mistakes stand out. It's like watching
the last ever episode of the 70's Battlestar Galactica ""The Return of
Starbuck"", but at least that show knew it was a bit of fun. This takes
itself very seriously, but it has a talking robot in it that looks like
a vending machine. Nuff said.

The set-up:It is the near future. The earth is drying up. Widower Cooper (Matthew
McConaughey), former astronaut cum corn grower and his family watch
their vast crop slowly wither. His family, including father-in-law
(John Lithgow) and two kids worry about a very bleak future. What to do?One day Cooper drives his large, tandem wheeled pickup into a remote
corner of the cornfield and stumbles upon a secret government
installation. He goes inside and meets the eminent astrophysicist,
Professor Brand (Michael Caine), who thinks very big indeed. To save
humanity, Brand and his team are searching for a habitable planet. But
none are close by, as in thousands of light years distant. What to do?No problem, says the professor. I've checked and rechecked my
equations! And, by the way, there are eleven other expeditions already
out there. We need to see who among them has succeeded. To span the
great distance in a reasonable time, you will traverse a wormhole. And,
conveniently, there just happens to be one not too far away. But, says
the professor, we need an experienced pilot like you to lead the
mission. What to do?A devoted father, Cooper is torn by this opportunity, not wanting his
kids to feel abandoned. But to save humanity, he'll go, and vows to
return, placating himself if not the kids.Lift off: Cooper and crew, including (surprise) the professor's beautiful
daughter, Dr. Brand (Anne Hathaway,) begin a long and dangerous
interstellar adventure... Back on earth his kids, true to form, begin
to wonder whether he has abandoned them. What happens next? Lots of suspense, astronaut jargon and cgi that will
entertain most, at least at first. But this space ride has just begun,
and the story, hinging on rather abstract astrophysical theory, may be
become just a tad difficult to fathom, unless you've been to Cal Tech
summer camp. But let's suppose you don't care about understanding the
story and simply enjoy immersion in the mystery of cool science and
thrill of a great movie ride in space. So, you sit tight and go through
the wormhole, sweating the experience alongside Cooper and Dr. Brand.
And, beyond. Although still very cool, suspenseful and thrilling, you are now in for
a long. long ride.The producers, writers, actors and others have invested considerable
creative energy, time, and money in making this movie, paying special
attention to getting the space physics right, but perhaps at the
expense of something far more basic: getting the movie physics right.
An enjoyable three hour movie requires a cosmic leap in attention span,
especially when combined with a complicated story line. So, one of two experiences await you: clever, cosmic yarn or deep space
yawn.Unfortunately, to find out, you will have to see the movie. Bon voyage!

Now I am a big fan of previous Chris Nolan films up until he ruined
Batman with silly plot holes in the dark knight rises but interstellar
could have been so much better. It is one of those films that is too clever for its own good as its
audience don't want to be educated they want to be entertained and
saying that if you don't understand a little bit of the theory you sat
there like what the f*ck is happening. The cinematography on the other hand is absolutely brilliant and
visually this film is outstanding, that being said the 'new worlds.
that are discovered really lack imagination, one is watery the other is
snowy. The characters are not relatable whatsoever so you find yourself not
caring what happens to them, the only fun characters to watch are the
robots. And Matthew M, would it kill you to do an accent that doesn't
make you sound like a dumb red neck and do an accent that makes you
smart enough to pilot a space ship. The story is very predictable, my brother guest the 'ghost' plot a mere
20 minutes into it. And a lot of the time you find yourself bored
waiting for something amazing to happen and for the film to actually
explore the wormholes. Its only the final 30 minutes of the film where
something interesting happens with that predictable plot. I wanted to like this film but it just felt like a rehash of 2001 and a
lot of the film just felt very slow in the beginning and rushed in the
important places. This film was good, but I will probably never watch it again. It one of
those movies where it's all been done before, so I don't understand the
9/10 given to IMDb. Interstellar just fails to reach light speed in my
opinion. Chris Nolan please stick to your broody action/psychological thrillers
and dramas!

If you want to watch good fiction, this movie is awesome.But if you try to make any sense out of this movie, you will find many
serious flaws in the concepts of this movie.Nolan tends to lose focus from the story line as usual and ends up with
same concept in every movie. The most ridiculous scene was when Cooper
enters into the gravitational field of black hole and finds out that
""they""(future human-beings) have created 3-D projections of his
daughters room in 5-D reality..This movie has made serious fun of Physics, Gravity and Black holes.Its just a fiction movie, highly overrated on IMDb.

At this point in his career, Christopher Nolan is just as respected as
Alfred Hitchcock was at the height of his fame. Audiences and critics
likewise adore his movies; in response, the movies themselves are
artistically ambitious while still providing enough fanfare for the
popcorn crowd.One could say that Interstellar is Nolan's Marnie. Marnie followed
Hitchcock's seminal The Birds, while Interstellar comes in the wake of
the billion-dollar The Dark Knight Rises. Nolan's reign as filmmaking
royalty world may not be over, but Interstellar is most certainly his
first failure. It's an interesting failure. But no matter how
interesting a failure is, a failure is a failure all the same.Like young adult authors and tweenaged girls, Nolan is interested in
the apocalypse, or, at least, the beginnings of one. The year the film
is set in is unknown, but if it's in our future or in our past, the
Earth is clearly in bad shape. A worldwide Dust Bowl is underway, but
rather than a few tumultuous years of drought, it's been decades. The
only food humanity can live on is corn as most animals have died and
all other plants have been ravaged by disease.The second we meet Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), we get the sense that
he will be our savior. A former NASA pilot and engineer, he is one of
the few people who still believes that the moon landing was real. He is
one of the few left that believes that society can do better than its
agrarian values. Suddenly, a strange binary pattern appears in the thick dust of his
daughter's room. Cooper is startled to find that the pattern codes for
a set of mysterious coordinates; coordinates, we later find out, to a
secret NASA installation.The head honcho of the organization, Professor Brand (Michael Caine),
reveals that there has been a discovery of a wormhole orbiting Saturn.
The wormhole, it seems, leads to other dimensions. If you haven't put
two and two together yet, this could mean that humanity has the chance
to immigrant to another planet and ultimately survive. It doesn't take
Cooper long to sign on as the pilot for Endurance, an experimental
spacecraft whose mission is to record the data of earlier, similar
expeditions. Cooper, however, is plagued by guilt: while he may be the
one and only hope for humanity, he is forced to leave his family, no
easy feat for a man who gave up his career for his personal life. While I can appreciate Interstellar's deft balance of intimate humanity
and accuracy in its science, nothing can hide the fact that, overall,
it's a messy, self-indulgent project. At nearly three hours, the
audience is forced to sit through a bevy of side-plots, uninteresting
dialogue, unbelievably unbelievable plot twists, and endlessly drawn
out scenes that are most likely supposed to make the film feel ""epic.""Nolan has proved to be uncompromising in his visions before (The Dark
Knight Rises was similar in both length and ambition), and usually,
this wouldn't be a bad thing. But after a while, Interstellar begins to
feel like the series Lost: at first, it's compelling, but as it moves
along, it completely flies off the rails. By the time the film is
finished, we're left with a series of questions and a lot of, frankly,
stupid answers.There seems to be one too many clues left behind, and when they're
solved, it's a little less cerebral and a lot more Nancy Drew. It's as
if all of our potential questions were written down only to be
addressed in a preposterous manner. The cast, though working their
hardest, sometimes give performances that are strained in their emotion
(Matt Damon's role is completely unneeded and gives the film its worst
scenes).If Interstellar was done as a straight science fiction thriller, like
Gravity, it could have been much better. It has all the makings for
one: a top-notch cast, a terrific premise, and ingenious art direction.
Yet, Nolan tries to pack in any extra details that he can. At its
closer, the film resembles a parfait filled five inches past the brim
of the cup. It's clear that he wants our minds to be blown, but my mind
was simply not blown. I was instead dumbfounded by the idea that Interstellar has been
getting good reviews and has been making so much money. It's so
overdrawn in everything it does that the once promising feeling of awe
is thrown away with a thud and a bang. Nolan is an excellent director,
but even the best of 'em can sometimes get carried away: this is
Nolan's failure, and while it may not be apparent now, its shelf-life
is nowhere near Memento's economic thrills or The Dark Knight
franchise's genius.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com

I'll start out by saying that I'd been looking forward to Interstellar
for months. I wouldn't consider myself a ""Nolanite"", but I do consider
him to be a good director who has done a lot to revolutionize film.
Since I don't generally go to theaters, I avoided almost all
information on this film (except for general reviews) until it came out
on DVD and I could watch it. The time finally came! I was so excited to
watch it and in the end I was....disappointed....and puzzled.
Interstellar ain't no Inception, or Dark Knight, or Prestige. In fact,
it's probably Nolan's weakest film. That's not to say that it's
terrible, but it does fall short in the end.Let's star with the positives: The film is absolutely stunning
visually. The effects are fantastic, as is the cinematography. The
scenes in space, the alien planets and the spacecraft are the best
parts of the film. You can tell Nolan did his research in these
instances and created a truly convincing world with believable
technology and science. I loved TARS and CASE, the blocky robots. They were something truly
original and unique. I liked that they both had their own personalities
and that they were truly there to help, and not have ""crazy robot
double motives"" as is so cliché in these types of film.Mathew McConaughey, Matt Damon, Mackenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain and the
criminally underused Casey Affleck all deliver fantastic performances.Finally, the concept of the film itself, is unique, original and
interesting.Unfortunately, there are quite a few negatives to this film that keep
it from being a great film:Like a lot of critics have pointed out, the dialogue tends to be a bit
sappy. Like most people, I groaned at Anne Hathaway's ""love"" speech, as
well as a lot of Cooper's overly ""inspirational"" speeches.On that note, I found Anne Hathaway, who I thought did a great job in
TDKR, to be flat, boring, passionless and generally uninteresting. Her
performance simply did nothing for me. Likewise, Michael Cain, who
usually knocks it out of the park, was uninteresting as well. Perhaps
it was his character, which is slightly unlikeable, but it just seemed
like he was playing a slightly different version of the character that
he always plays in Nolan movies. Like I mentioned above, Casey Affleck
was criminally underused. The guy's a great actor and there was
potential for so much more to his character, but it wasn't used.And then there's the biggest problem of all: The last third of the
film. The film was genuinely exciting, interesting and enthralling
right up until (SPOILER!! SPOILER!! SPOILER!!) Cooper goes into
Gargantua. From here the film goes completely off the rails into the
realm of near ridiculousness. Here, the story that was fairly
plausible, goes completely out the window into a confusing, silly,
overly convenient mess. This is where the film stalls and it doesn't
really get better from then on out. And that's perhaps the worst thing
of all. Until this part, this is an excellent film. It could have gone
in a different direction to END as an excellent film, but
unfortunately, it doesn't.Still, I applaud Nolan for making something truly original and unique.
In this world of reboots and remakes, it's very nice to see an original
idea. And like I said, the film is stunning visually. If you're a fan
of sci-fi, science, space or Nolan, I recommend RENTING this. Just be
aware that it falls well short of his past works such as Inception,
Memento and The Dark Knight.

Although this movie is in theaters since the beginning of November,
there are no tickets left to watch it in Istanbul, Turkey. I had the
chance to watch it finally. It was a great experience for me to watch
this movie with all those excited people, who thrilled by the effects
and emotional things in the movie. Maybe the visual effects are not
sufficient in a few things. But in general, our eyes and brains had the
most pleasant moments during the movie. For the Turkish audiences, I suggest them to read this info after you
saw the movie. It included some facts and scientific reviews about the
movie. :http://www.evrimagaci.org/fotograf/71/6710You may say I'm a dreamer but, I'm looking forward to see the second

I know there are some films that people get very passionate about. This
passion is generally aroused because the movie is of a certain genre
that they love or features an actor/director that they admire. There is
no doubt that Interstellar is such a movie. It is a sci-fi film
directed by Christopher Nolan and as such is a film that many people
will have a big emotional investment with. If you read a few of the
other reviews you will see this shining through.The film tells the story of earth as it struggles with food shortages.
A worm hole is discovered in the solar system which gives mankind a
chance to find a new home and source of food. The challenge facing
those that leave and Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) in particular is
leaving the people they love back on earth. I found the film beautifully shot, but a bit ponderous at times. The
cast oozes quality though, so it's never dull. I will watch the film
again to see if a second viewing may result in a more passionate
response! If you are really into sci-fi movies or Christopher Nolan I
am quite sure you will absolutely love the film.

This was not a bad movie, but it's average at best, and certainly
nothing like the 9/10 rating on here. Some scenes were nicely done and
the acting was solid, but the movie was overly moody and melodramatic,
with emotions often being *hammered* home with a screaming music score.
The science seemed arbitrary, implausible, and sometimes laughable.
They were able to travel through wormholes and put humans into long
term hibernation, but they somehow couldn't manage blight-resistant
crops. The launch vehicle silo at the secret NASA site appeared to be
mixed in with cubicles and offices. The black hole science is so flawed
that it isn't worth discussing. There were also too many big stars in
this film. I started to wonder who was going to make a cameo appearance
next. And finally, the who story line is a familiar time loop plot,
albeit with additional dimensions thrown into the mix. The more I
write, the lower I want to rate this movie. Reexamination is not
recommended.

I didn't like it nearly as much as I hoped.**** SPOILERS AHEAD **** The first 20-30 minutes were a great setup -
earth dying, society turning its back on technology to focus on
survival. Scenes reminiscent of the Dust Bowl, but then in the middle
there's this modern ruggedized laptop computer. Wow. And having the
girl be the scientific one was a very nice touch.After that, it started to go off the rails. The sentry robot was
preposterous. It was obvious which characters were going to die and in
what order. The first spaceship launch was cool, showed two booster
stages with immense fuel tanks. Then, once they're past the wormhole,
the same ship is able to land on a planet with higher gravity, and take
off, with no external fuel tanks? I just couldn't get into the
""tesseract"". As Neal Tyson pointed out, if he can make objects move
that way, then why not just write his daughter a note? Wouldn't it be
easier to fix what's wrong with the Earth rather than repopulate a
different one? It reminded me of other movies, most of which I liked
better: 2001, Deep Impact, Contact, Silent Running (early 1970's).Finally, it was just too long. I kept looking at my watch, always a bad
sign). Some of the science in ""Gravity"" was just as preposterous, but
at least that one kept me interested.I'll give it a C for effort, maybe a B-. And I really did like the part
where the daughter is struggling on earth at the same ""time"" that her
dad is fighting to survive on his planet.

I went into this movie with high hopes. Glad I had a DVD to fast
forward.Spoilers spoilers spoilers.... OK, the crops are dying and we have a
new dust bowl, so far, so good. But it went on and on. (and on and
on....and on and on) And as another reviewer pointed out, we have this
secret underground NASA base just a stones throw from where his farm
is. Uh Huh. OK, So, gee, he 'wanders in'..and will leave the next day
on the hidden spaceship to save the world!I buy that, don't you?Now, it did have a GREAT idea, as we go through the wormhole, we
'could' pop out at a different time. Forward in time , and 'MAYBE'
backward. OK, this could get interesting, could they pop out BEFORE the
dust bowl and return to earth? (and save the world?)Nope.But they do find the other astronauts who went out before them, but I
won't give that part away. Land on a few planets.And the robot, at first, I thought, what a CHEAP looking robot, but I
took a liking to it. 'He' actually saves the day. His name is TARS.
Kind of liked him.I gave it one star to balance out those 9 stars.

Interstellar is, ultimately, the story of a man who flies into a black
hole and finds that it's full of books much better than the movie's own
plot.Yes, most of the science in it is correct, at least during the first
two thirds of the movie, and that by itself puts it ahead of all the
nonsensical ""sci-fi"" that fails at both plot AND science. But it's
still only half the ticket.The cinematography is excellent, the special effects are almost
flawless (without ever calling too much attention to themselves), most
of the actors are convincing in their roles (with the spectacular and
probably quite expensive exception of Dr. Mann), and both the direction
and editing are very good.But when a plot about interstellar travel ends up as a sentimentalist
(albeit four-dimensional) metaphor for father-daughter communication
issues, complete with emotionally manipulative music and tears
trickling down cheeks, you can't help but feel that the writer couldn't
really grasp the scope of what he was dealing with. It's like watching
the best roadies in the world put together the greatest stage in the
world, so the finest musicians in the world can play ""Three Blind
Mice"". You keep thinking ""there has to be more than this"", but there
isn't. In fact, it turns out there's even less.To quote Stephen King, ""coming back to where you grew up is like doing
some crazy yoga trick, putting your feet in your own mouth and somehow
swallowing yourself so there's nothing left"". And (in clear defiance of
King's follow-up line, which IMDb won't allow me to quote) that's
exactly what Interstellar's plot manages to do.I guess there were some hints along the way; a few pretentious-sounding
but ultimately meaningless lines, such as ""love is the one thing we're
capable of perceiving that transcends time and space"" (huh?), or ""the
only thing that can move across dimensions, like time, is gravity"" (I
imagine the film's scientific advisors lost some hair over that one).
But I still wasn't expecting the story to suddenly eat itself like it
did, both in terms of time (because it goes into an impossible loop)
and in terms of gravity (the other kind of gravity - because it loses
all sense of the relative importance of the events taking place).Even the tributes to other sci-fi classics are done in a way that
suggests the writer's imagination never rose very far from the ground.
Arthur C. Clarke's monolith, a symbol of transcendent intelligence, is
reduced to a kind of robotic sidekick, used as a mix of comic relief
and deus ex machina solution to human incompetence. And then there are the obvious plot holes, like how they need a huge
rocket to launch a small ""lander"" from Earth into orbit, but that same
lander can take off from all the other planets they visit on its own,
without any need for booster rockets or extra fuel. Finally, the ""feel-good"" ending (a man and his robotic dog riding into
the sunset to save a damsel, after having thoroughly saved everyone
else) seems like something pulled out of Starship Troopers (but without
its tongue-in-cheekness), and I get the feeling it was added because
some focus group wasn't happy leaving Matthew McConaughey trapped in
library limbo (I wonder if the ""tesseract"" was a deliberate nod to
Pratchett's L-Space; that would almost make me give it another star).Overall, it's probably still worth watching. It's not insultingly bad,
like (for example) Prometheus. But don't expect Stanislaw Lem levels of
insight into scientific philosophy or mankind's relationship with the
cosmos. Think of it as a two-hour dramatised documentary about a space
trip that somehow got mixed with one hour of a soap-opera writer trying
to justify his pay.

Great music. An extremely talented cast. Amazing special effects.
Captivating issues to contemplate. So why do I think I will not ponder
this film long after I have viewed it? The story is convoluted, though
interesting. All the drama and mystery and intrigue leads to a finale
that tells us what? Well, not really much. But it's a fun trip getting
there.I liked many of the characters. And I was invested in their problems
and tragedies. But the final ""explanation"" of the film's phenomena has
a ""Sixth Sense"" feeling to it. I say see this film for its good points, but don't expect the
groundbreaking impact of Kubrick's ""2001"" or the atmospherics of ""Blade
Runner"" or the thrilling ride of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".

While the movie was visually great, and despite the fact I saw the
movie in Sydney IMAX theater which is one of the greatest screens in
the world, the movie was one of the most boring pictures I have ever
seen in my life.To me, it seems that the writers (including Nolan) was heard some
shallow aspects of modern physics, relativity, and quantum mechanics,
without any understanding and tried hopelessly to visualize them. The
result is ridiculous especially using so called ""Strings"" to make a
disruption in time-space, or flying fast through a black hole. I am not
a physicist but have the school level understanding of black-holes.TARS was the most inefficient and crippled robot one can ever imagine
even with today's standards. and why they did send real persons to
another galaxy instead of robots?! Even in our galaxy we send robots
for decades to live on MARS before we send a real human.The list can go on and on. While I love 'Inspection' and 'The Dark
Knight' and watched each of them more than ten times, I will NEVER go
back and watch interstellar again. Even the first time was waste of
time and money.PS: Guys PLEASE do not compare it to '2001: a space odyssey'. Kubrick
creation is and will remain a masterpiece in sci-fi genre and was and
is very accurate and consistent to knowledge and based on Arthur C.
Clarke novel.

Initially, this movie was an interesting approach to a well-worn
plot... Environmental disaster causes colonization in space... The dust
bowl setting was convincing and we wanted to sympathize with the
engineer turned farmer and his family. A series of bizarre occurrences
lead to a dash to save the world as we know it... And all science from
the sci fi deserts us about halfway in... Apparently it's now
sufficient to use a few familiar phrases... Relativity, wormhole,
Gravity, space time continuum... Without actually tying any of it to a
remotely possible set of scenarios... Where psychic connections, love
conquers all and a little morse code suspend all science or reality and
the good guys miraculously survive and conquer.

I had a lot of science-loving friends tell me this was a cool movie
with lots of cool science in it. So there's one opinion. Rebuttal: This movie has a lot of theoretical science in it. We're not
talking about lab-tested, data-driven, peer-reviewed, researched,
non-sexy, ""Go NASA!"" science. We're talking maybe this could work based
on quantum physics, postulate, postulate. Maybe I've read too much
science fiction based on these concepts, but I was not impressed.
Rather, increasingly mystified and annoyed. Really? Really?!And, what this movie severely lacks is any kind of sense-making story.I, like the protagonist's daughter, never got over the fact that this
single Dad thought it would be more fun to play space cowboy than to
try to help his kids contend with life on a dying planet. What an
asshole.The movie clearly points out (in dialog by the protagonist) that it
makes no sense for this guy to be the one to be called into space. His
qualifications, as far as we know, include crashing a plane.But, he's the one who has to save the world. And he's game (a lot more
fun than farming). How convenient.It all felt very heartless. It's great if you happen to be that one
pivotal guy (pick me! pick me!) and sucks to be everybody else.Also, despite the fact that the movie has two smart women scientists in
it, it barely passes the Bechdel test (does talking to a recording
count?).One of the women is there to be our protagonist's love interest. And
the love of her life dies. How convenient.I also admit to a personal pet peeve when stories venture too far out
into space, when the ""science,"" enters into the territory of science
fiction and we don't get any aliens. Seems like a failure of
imagination to me. Meanwhile, we (humanity) just landed on an asteroid and we're on our
way to explore Pluto at the farthest edges of our galaxy! IRL! This
exploration based on and made possible by nuts and bolts, measure test,
measure test, science blows anything that happened in Interstellar
away.Strongly prefer ""Gravity"" for a good space movie. Maybe it didn't get
all the science right, but it looked cool AND told a great story.I recently read Mary Robinette Kowal's novella ""The Lady Astronaut of
Mars."" This awesome story  which also involves a choice between
personal dreams and the excitement of space exploration and staying
behind and supporting loved ones  would make a fantastic movie and it
has a lot of heart.

are other very obvious mistakes. Haha. it is said that the hero gets in
the 5D space. let us make an example. in 1D world the ant would be
blocked by a spot. however, when the ant get into the 2D world, the
spot would not be the block anymore, which means the block in lower

- Definitely better than Gravity, for me.- Bit slow for a long movie, almost fell asleep.- The background music was so loud, couldn't hear some dialogs.- Just because you travel at speed of light, I don't agree you age
slower. I don't think Einstein meant this by his special theory of
relativity, but if he did, I don't agree with him either.- Liked Matthew's action.- Matt Damon should not have accepted his role :) especially with

Yet another Nolan's film. With all the flaw and strong sides
(scientific accuracy not being one of them). There are many
questionable moments in the plot, related to the characters, such as
why wouldn't a man wish to send his sick child to a safer place? What's
the message of the film - don't leave your beloved ones behind? Don't
mess with your mother-planet?But most annoying were to me personally the scientific inaccuracies.
Sending a message back from the event horizon just like that? Yeah,
right!... Tidal forces of such a magnitude that cause such an
incredible waves, yet, they don't tear the planet apart? Or at least

The various merits or demerits of Christopher Nolan's style of
film-making is beside the point.This was the worst plotted and written major sci-fi film I have ever
paid good money to see. Having seen it a few months ago now, that
response firmly stays with me. To be sure, it had sumptuous production
values and committed performances but this film cannot be considered
serious sci-fi for how poorly it was plotted and written. I read that
it had been written with serious scientific input from experts on black
holes but that didn't show to me.Now I like space opera and I also like sci-fi films with ideas, the
bigger the better. Black holes are incredibly complicated phenomena for
the eggheads to understand, let alone the average or even the serious
film-goer. Black holes also speculatively throw up all sorts of
illogical ideas about their nature, which cause headaches for the
scientists but which can be fun to work through on the silver screen. I
wanted to like this film. I don't need my sci-fi to make perfect sense. I love Kubrick's 2001. I
like the mystery and awe engendered by contemplating the cosmos,
whether philosophically or dramatically. I just felt as I watched this
film how my intelligence was being increasingly insulted by logical
non-sequiturs of plot and character - even allowing for a scenario
involving black holes where all kinds of paradoxes could and should be
thrown at the characters and played around with - which were in my
judgement the result of plain bad or lazy writing. This script had it
not been written by the Nolans would never in my opinion have been
passed in a film school project, let alone made into a big-budget film.
I have ticked the box about the spoilers alert but I am not sure I have
any spoilers to spill. It was a few months ago that I saw the film and
I can now barely remember the plot because it made no sense to me on
any level at the time. Even if a plot isn't easy to understand and
appears illogical, and once again I re-iterate that with the inherent
nature of the subject we are talking about metaphysical paradoxes here
big-time, it ought to have an inner logic, make an inner sense. This
was just a script-writing mess as far I could judge it. Incidentally, watching his Batman film I thought there was some very
lazy plotting in that too, so this wasn't a one off. Does no one in
Hollywood care anymore about good writing? Are major films now all
about 'never mind the quality feel the width'?

just hate Nolan; or Nolan-lovers should I say! constant bombardment of
science humbug (correspondence to theory is not the point). contrast it
with the silence of 2001! contrast it with the film it tries to
imitate. Now an average sci-fi story is elevated into the rank of
greatest films, without even a solid cinematic base, except those
visuals and effects that become a standard technical expertise.You science-geniuses all needed this information overload to accept a
not-even average story as a cinematic masterpiece. How I hope the days
come when this movie shall share its honorable place in the dustbin of
history alongside Battlefield Earth or Armageddon etc., when the Nolan
fanboys and its industrial franchise fade away.

I was looking forward to this movie, with its elements of adventure and
discoveries during interstellar travel. But the movie has too many
unbelievable plot elements that ruined the experience for me. The
superb music, the special effects and the actors saved it from being a
disaster. Here are some of the indigestibles.When Cooper is fighting with Dr. Mann, the spacecraft coming to save
him is flying *underneath* a rock formation. But I do not remember from
other scenes that it actually contained these caves. Not so nice.More problematic is that we were led to believe the method of
hibernation: sit in a fluid, lie down, and somebody else zips the bag.
Apparently there was no problem with suffocation, even without an
oxygen mask? Also, we are to believe that if the pod is opened, the bag
is unzipped, and somebody sits you up, you will just wake up with all
our memories in tact immediately? Unbelievable. Besides, how did Dr.
Mann zip his bag and close his pod?Worst, touching at the core of the movie, Cooper discovered a binary
code in his daughter's room, apparently coming from ""the others""
(postulated 4 dimensional creatures). With this information, he finds
the NASA quarter and is invited to join the space mission. Later, it is
suggested that it was he himself communicating the code to himself,
while he was being trapped in the 4 dimensional room. Yet, in another
scene, he tried to convince his daughter not to let him go (because now
he knows that he will get trapped). These two messages are clearly
contradictory. Besides the time loop paradox that it involves: how
could he communicate the coordinates of the NASA quarters to himself
BEFORE he left, in order to leave? And then get trapped in the 4
dimensional room, so he could try to PREVENT himself to leave? (Even
the last part alone, is paradoxical, because he could only warn himself
because he left, and so how could he not leave?) This unexplained
paradox ruins the movie for me. I found it unbelievable that Prof. Brand would lie about his findings,
in order to be able to motivate the crew. I believe that he should have
been honest, in order to INCREASE the success of the mission. I believe
people can make moral decisions with full information. If it was
impossible to return, it would only make it more important to succeed
in colonizing another planet. He deceived them in believing that he
could not solve the equations that would tell him how to return, but
that he could solve them before they returned. Prof. Brand had in fact
solved the equations and it had told him that it was impossible (!) to
come back. Therefore, Cooper's daughter, when she found out about this
deception on Prof. Brand's death bed, could never find out if her
father knew before he left that he would not be able to return. Later
she discovered that her father was communicating to her through the
watch, and she was hoping for his return despite Prof. Brand's belief.
Why? There was no mention of anybody negating Prof. Brand's results.
Unbelievable.Then, at last, it turned out, that it WAS possible to return and Prof.
Brand had been WRONG! Also very unlikely and unbelievable. In a
scientific team, results are checked and tested. So, even if Prof.
Brand believed it was impossible to return, now we know that he was
wrong. So, if his conclusions had been checked, another solution could
have been found.In fact, without knowing anything further about the movie than its
title, I theorized that the crew would end up colonizing another planet
as the ONLY survivors (and I would love to see how they discovered this
for themselves). I was wrong, but Prof. Brand believed it, so I wasn't
that stupid, was I? The movie did not deliver, though. I have more objections to the movie, such as the bleak portrayal of the
""inhabitable"" planets. If we will ever be able to do interstellar
travel, we'll have a good idea for what kind of planet we are looking
for. We will have very sensitive telescopes and computers that analyze
the data of a 720 degree (i.e. full 3D range) input channel and gives
us exact data about atmospheres of planets within range (tens of light
years). It was disappointing that a lot of interesting aspects of interstellar
travel and colonizing have not been touched upon in this movie. We
might find life forms much different from ours and it will be
challenging to live in harmony with them during colonization.I wish I could be more positive about this movie as I had high hopes
for it. And although now I would not recommend this movie to any SF
movie lover, because of the highly problematic plot, I found the actors
proficient and skillful. They made the psychological and interpersonal
aspects of the plot acceptable, so that I conclude that the characters
were sufficiently detailed and human for my taste. It's what I've
missed of vision that prevents me from enjoying what was visible.

I don't get the reviews of this film! The last 30 minutes or so brought
back memories of the bizarre ending to Knowing. What was destroying the
Earth? How was the lead saved near Saturn? How did 23 years pass in the
time on the planet? How did our leading man keep his tan for so long??
I'm also not sure why when the face visor was cracked was there a
struggle for air or why it took Brand so long to find him... They were
only walking distance and down a small hill! I loved Christopher Nolans
Batman trilogy but something went wrong here. It was a horrid piece
with too many inconsistencies. I know one should suspend belief in a
movie but seriously! Sadly, I will never claim back those 2 hours and
49 minutes. At least previews were decent!! This was reminiscent of The
Tree of life just so bad!

Interstellar represents Christopher Nolan exceeding his reach in his
obsession with difficult, gamechanging films. What he achieved with
Inception he has bungled here with a overlong narrative that alternates
between confusing and lazy.At 2hrs 50, this movie goes on far too long, and I blame the film's
ridiculous indulgence in unnecessary subplots. Who cares if Brand is in
love with one of the missing scientists? Who cares if Cooper's grandson
has a cough? None of it contributes to the film's main plot (which
itself is hard to describe after all the nonsensical science jibber).
No original screenplay should be as long as this film is.The script is very lazy in some sections - if something needs to be
somewhere, or explode, or if a realisation needs to be had, it will
happen, no matter whether it makes sense or not. At times, Nolan
attempts to explain why it happened but his explanations often just
muddy the waters. He indulges in far too many deus ex machina for one
film, and the film's final act follows Edge of Tomorrow and Fury to be
one of the sappiest and most predictable endings to ruin what was meant
to be a sad moment.The acting is fairly good, though the tanned, drawling McConaughey is
horrendously miscast as an intellectual astronaut (though he plays the
loving father with far greater conviction). Michael Caine plays Michael
Caine for the 6th Nolan film in a row, and despite being seen in scenes
23 years apart he looks exactly the same. At this point, Michael Caine
needs to start demonstrating some range or be remembered as one of the
weakest recipients of two Academy Awards in history. Matt Damon and
Casey Affleck are very memorable in brief scenes, with well-defined and
motivated characters. Anne Hathaway is the film's highlight, as the
film's female lead, she is fully at home in a spacesuit and providing
much of the film's emotion. Jessica Chastain and McKenzie Foy are both
hauntingly effective as Murph, with Chastain in particular giving a
very impressive and emotional turn.Soundwise, Interstellar plays one giant crescendo, but once your ears
adjust its a rather nice score. Visually, I am disappointed to note
that Interstellar brought absolutely nothing new to the table -
everything they did had been done before or better in Inception,
Gravity or even Apollo 13. The plants looked beautiful, but there is
nothing groundbreaking about creating water or ice through CGI. The
visuals of outer space were lazily constructed save for the black hole,
which would have been forgivable if Gravity wasn't such a recent
memory.However, at the end of the day there is something unshakeably beautiful
or memorable about Interstellar, and that feeling is the only thing
that keeps Interstellar in positive review territory. Ultimately, this
film will become one of those ""I'm glad I saw it, but I won't watch it
again"".

I enjoyed the basics of this movie although it does have lots of areas
that you could pull to pieces, but in saying that I would probably have
given it a 9/10 as it did keep me interested until the end.....HOWEVER>>>>>> What caused me to mark it down to a 6 was the awful
music!!! to say that it was loud is not really accurate, it is
OVERPOWERING! In some parts you struggle to hear the dialogue it was
that bad. I find it very disappointing when a director resorts to using
this type of cheap trick(the loudness) to crank up the tension, when
honestly the action, the acting and the plot coupled with the excellent
CGI would have been enough, for me it had the opposite effect, it
actually caused me to lose interest as the movie went on because of the
annoyance factor.I should have heeded the warning as this director used the same trick,
to a lesser degree on Gravity, which I thought again used loud
music/sound when it wasn't necessary.Sadly, I will not watch this movie again because of the sound, but if
it is re-scored or even reissued without the music, then I will
definitely watch it again.As with everything, you should make your own mind up and decide what
you think.
"

I watched this painfully boring movie to the end - All 2+ hours of it.
Everything in the film rang false. I am not as erudite as some of the
negative reviewers here but they are not lying.I hate movies that try to press the same fake emotional buttons over
and over again. Parental guilt, love, duty, heroism, blah, blah, blah.
This movie does it at every turn until you can't stop groaning.The suspension of disbelief. What every work of fiction aims to
achieve. Once that stops working you're in trouble. No you can't drive
a truck at top speed with a flat tire through a cornfield without
losing control. No corn is not harvested by a combine and left lying on
the ground when it is green. Then there were a lot of scientific facts
that were ignored or glossed over about space travel. I'm not a
scientist but there were many times when I said, ""Wait, what, that
doesn't sound right"". Anyway I think I reached the minimum number of
characters so I can stop. Do not pay to see this movie. Enough said.
"
158,1,"
When I watch a movie, I want to be drawn in, care about the people and
their problems, feel the urgency of the situation, experience the awe
when exploring new worlds. This movie did not do the for me.I really could not relate to the characters. I did not care what
happened to them, how they felt, what they had to go through. None of
them seemed very likable either. The father (a redneck with a southern
drawl  that strangely disappeared during the movie) did not seem to
care a lot about his children. The son grew up to be an asshole who did
not seem to care about his wife (a submissive domestic drudge who
seemed to be afraid of her husband) and child. And the daughter, Murph,
never got over the fact that her father left her to save the world (no
less!) and was totally messed up. One moment you see the son and
daughter as children, the next time you see them they are grown-ups, at
least 25 years older and you do not have a clue what happened to them
in between. And quite frankly, you do not give a damn either.The situation: planet Earth is dying and the few people left, are
farmers now. Do we see anything of our dying planet? No. Just a
farmhouse in a dusty cornfield in the middle of Mid-West Nowhere. Does
it look ominous? Not in the least. Does it look like a disaster waiting
around the corner? No. All the rednecks still seem to be driving their
enormous gas-guzzlers (where do they get the fuel from?) and they do
not seem to bother about the world, let alone doing noticeable effort
to find a solution. So does it look like a problem that urgently need
to be solved. Not really.But wait, dad has dashed off in a space ship to find another world, so
probably they spent decades of their time watching the sky for him to
return with the good news, rather than assuming that he maybe never
will come back and that it maybe would be a good idea to see if they in
the mean time could find some solution. But no. They all wait for our
hero to come back through the black hole to tell them that there is a
paradise waiting at the other side of the hole.Daddy in the mean time, spends his days with two colleagues that he
does not really like, exploring outer space. And guess what, after a
refreshing 2-year nap, they go through the hole and what do they find?
Water World and Ice Age. Really? This is the best they could come up
with? Is it stunning? No, I have seen water and ice before.Well, to cut a (very) long story short, after exploring those worlds
daddy jumps in the black hole and guess what? He tumbles right into his
old house in the cornfields and lands behind the bookshelves in his
daughter's bedroom. It all looks like a bad LSD-trip. But somehow he
manages to manipulate the hands of a watch, and his daughter
immediately understands that that is a message from her father and
saves the world.The whole story is wrapped up with some sentiment and our hero flies
off to the woman he never liked, but who now suddenly seem to be the
love of his life. The end.This all is laced with pseudo-scientific gibberish and endless,
endless, endless scenes about people in a spaceship arguing and people
in the farmhouse in the dusty cornfield arguing.If a gigantic meteor would have fallen out of the sky and would have
destroyed that farmhouse and that darn dusty cornfield to begin with, I
could have spent the remaining 3 hours to something more useful. And I
couldn't have cared less.

This is by far the worst movie of 2014.Character development doesn't exists in this movie, nor any interesting
dialogs or any real suspense moments. The plot is dragging way too long
and doesn't reach any climax. If the film would have been 90 minutes
long instead of 170 it could have been less of a torture.The film score is irritating and dull, which suits the banal script
just fine.I don't remember when was the last time I left the theater so angry and
bored before watching this movie. Just stay away from this banal piece
of nothing.

I'm guessing that a lot of the people who went to this movie - and
wrote reviews - are science fiction buffs. I am not. But I do like a
good movie, regardless of it's genre. And this wasn't it.The only thing that held the movie even slightly together is Matthew
McConaughey. Otherwise it was totally unbelievable. The weather
disturbances that are ruining the planet are unexplained. The
protagonist just accidentally running into a secret NASA station is
unbelievable. The 5 dimension thing is a cop out. Given the large
budget for this movie, I'm surprised that they didn't have the kind of
detailed and interesting settings and backdrops that one might expect
in a movie that is almost 3 hours long.And don't forget to bring your hearing protectors. I luckily did bring
mine since I have tinnitus in my ears. Even my 28db mufflers were
barely enough, as the seats were shaking slightly in a few scenes. I
think that it is irresponsible for the movie industry to have such
dangerously high db levels with no notification or advisory label.Matthew McConaughey is at the peak of his career and has done some
really great movies over the past few years. This one, however, is just
a throw away.
"
161,1,"
I bought the studio hype that this was the most ""intelligent"" sic-fi
film since 2001: Space Odyssey. What an insult to Kubrick. LIke the
Dark Knight Rise, Interstellar is 3 long hours of torture, from the
moment McCanaughey accidentally stumbles upon NASA's gigantic secret
launch operation -- just happens to be in a cornfield a few miles from
him, and they never noticed! And by the way, as long as you're here,
could you pilot the mission? We just never had any plans for a pilot
until you barged in! Christ, this is a plot device from Gilligan's
Island.The rest of this turkey might be summed up as ""weepy soap opera in
outer space."" Too many schmaltzy tearjerker scenes for an ""intelligent""
sic-fi film. Anne Hathaway acts more like a chirpy cheerleader than a
seasoned astronaut. And like Dark Knight, the plot is so convoluted
that I eventually gave up caring. The final scenes, perhaps somewhat
inspired by 2001, are lame and pretentious.I'd rather be waterboarded than suffer through Nolan's dreck again. I'm
giving this 1 star to balance the ludicrous spate of 9-10 star reviews.
No wonder American film has gone downhill, when the audiences mistake a
pretentious, poorly written fruit pie for the ""masterpiece of a genius""
"
162,3,"
I'm not used to write reviews, but this time i must put down something
because i had been waiting for this movie, i really wanted to watch it.Yes, i was a bit surprised reading negative comments on IMDb, but it
helped: after that i was a little suspicious, something like ""OK, maybe
it's not a masterpiece..."". Anyway, let's give a chance and go to the
theater.12 meters screen, Dolby 7.1, popcorn, nothing is missing, turn off the
lights and let's start.. Special effects: they're OK, nothing amazing but they're OK. But
that's the good part. Now the rest.. Plot: childish. 5 minutes before you know what it's going to happen,
always. And holes everywhere.. Dialogues: predictable, flat, no humor, no irony.. Acting: impossible to judge, too damn stupid plot, every actor has 7
words at max to say for every scene. And after the first two hours you
struggle to stay awake, no way to judge acting.. Science facts: hilarious. Probably written by the same child
responsible for the plot.. Length: almost 3 hours, a real torture considering quality.. Soundtrack: music tries to put some tension in the movie but there
are no miracles and sometimes results are even disturbing.. Final: ""How long have we recorded until now? 3 hours already? OK,
maybe it's enough, let's finish it somehow, any idea? But a short one,
please"". That's all. Mr. Christopher Nolan gave us Inception, a great movie, and
now nothing more than a soup: take something from 2001 A Space
Oddissey, mix it with several SF movies, serve all together with no
virtue, many errors and you got Interstellar.There's no trace of masterpiece here (as it's possible to read in some
comments): Interstellar is arrogant, pedantic, confused, self-indulgent
and very, hardly, deeply, terribly boring.And it doesn't matter if Matthew McConaughey, Matt Damon, Michael Caine
or Anne Hathaway appear: on the contrary, it's a real waste of talents,
we all know it would be possible to make a great movie with this cast.I'm going to write something that i didn't imagine: avoid it. I took 3
hours of my life and throwed them down the drain. Be smarter.

Christopher Nolan tears the environment a new one. Thanks, Nolan. You
could discuss this movie in terms of its irrationality, its flawed
physics, its attempts at explaining time travel and worm-holes (in a
movie packed with plot-holes), its pseudo-scientific explanation of the
'existence' of love in humans, its overuse of the already overused
'Don't go gently into that good night' a poem both politically suspect
and over-familiar to the point of banality. You could discuss it in
terms of its stereotypical absence of mum and the struggling hero dad,
its general bag-of-spanners story-telling ability throw stuff in and
rattle it about. The fact it's a whole load of old twaddle told in a
way that's an insult to the intelligence. But what really pisses me off
is its stance on our environment. Early on Matthew McConaughey, our
hero, the protagonist whom we follow throughout the movie, says:
Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here. His
intellectual mentor, Michael Caine, says: We're not meant to save the
world. We're meant to leave it. THIS this let's screw up the world and
then move on attitude what is destroying the world around us as we sit
here is condoned, confirmed, seen as inevitable, advocated as the way
to go. Let's find another planet. Settle there. Screw it up too. Move
on again. Reactionary, Republican, right-wing manifest destiny across
the universe. Yeah. Good one, Nolan.

Went in to see this film this afternoon and had high hopes. After an
hour in I realised that I nearly nodded off twice as the music score
playing over the beginning quarter of the film was sleep inducing to
say the least. It didn't help that not one of the characters was
engaging in anyway possible, especially Matthew McConaughey's drawling
southern accent. It seem to take an age for anything to happen in the film, and finally
when there was some movement, director Nolan slows everything back down
to a snail's pace. I'm not saying the film was ridiculous as it is purely science fiction
which I normally enjoy, but this was a challenge for me to stay till
the end of the film ,-( two gents in the theatre walked out just over
an hour in and never came back), I unfortunately didn't have the
hindsight to do the same, otherwise I would have got over three hours
of my life back to watch two good films.When the film is released on DVD/BR, I hope they have a cut that last's
about 1hour and 20m which should make it an entertaining film without
the huge unnecessary spongy filling.

INTERSTELLAR (2014) ***1/2 Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica
Chastain, Michael Caine, John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Mackenzie Foy,
Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi, William Devane,
Leah Cairns, Topher Grace, Timothy Chalamet, Brooke Smith (voice of
Bill Irwin) Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's valentine (of sorts) to 2001:
A SPACE ODYSSEY (and to his daughter) continues his streak of audacious
sense of space (literally) and the inner human spirit : set in the
bleak future Earth is on the descent of humanity with continuous food
demands and climate change with one Hail Mary of a plan by NASA - send
a small crew thru a wormhole (just go with it) to see if 'they' can
help us. A grand ensemble of talent assembled but it is truly a shining
moment of cool-as-a-cucumber and deeply felt performance by McConaughey
as the astronaut/pilot of the journey into the realms of desperation,
anchoring the film with a transfixing turn (largely due to his
interplay with young talented actress Foy as his daughter - later
played with clear-eyed intensity by Chastain), no easy task with all
the eye candy visuals that are indeed awe inspiring and a kissing
cousin to GRAVITY for sheer amazement (one must see it on a big screen
and IMAX would be a start as it was filmed in the medium). Hathaway has
a few moments as well particularly with her brainy scientist dad Caine
(a Nolan regular). The true stars are the breathtaking cinematography
by Hoyte Van Hoytema, a stellar score by frequent collaborator Hans
Zimmer and fantastic visual effects by literally dozens of geniuses.
The only stumbling block is its slightly heavy handed message getting
across but the Twilight Zone-ish final act makes up for it in spades.
WOW!

After the success of his Batman trilogy, Christopher Nolan went back to
doing original stuff for the first time in a few years after Inception
became his highest grossing original film in the USA/Canada. The
result? Interstellar, a movie that has to be seen in IMAX and on bluray
to enjoy the amazing visual effects and sound mix. The movie runs a bit
longer than his last long movie, The Dark Knight Rises, but unlike that
movie, there's not a lot of action. Too many lines of dialogue which
can be hard to understand, and lack of romance. The music by Hans
Zimmer is worth a listen on Spotify, and the robot in the movie is very
funny.
"

A great science fiction movie, with an amazing plot and of course a
very talented director. No one can deny Nolan's talent, all his movies
are well made and Interstellar is one of his best works. Some people
say that the plot of Interstellar is confusing but I don't think so
(maybe because I've watched this movie more than 20 times). Still we
can say that it's a bit confusing if you're watching it for the first
time but don't worry it won't be confusing after the second or the
third watch.Something that really impressed me in the movie is that when something
explodes in space, there is no sound, simply because of the vacuum. In
many science fiction movies the audience can hear the sound of
explosion, gun fire,etc in space, which makes it look less realistic.
But in Interstellar every single thing is physically correct, because
Nolan had many consultations with physicists to make the movie
realistic.Interstellar has many emotional and dramatic scenes too which makes it
different from the other science fiction movies. It shows us the pain
of a father who left his kids and went to space to search for a new
home for the mankind.Interstellar is an amazing movie and it's definitely worth watching.
"
168,8,"
Christopher Nolan's most recent film is an epic adventure in space
filled with science and philosophy as the characters go into an
interstellar expedition in order to save humanity. It is I think the
British director's most mature work and it could have been his best
picture if not for its disappointing ending. One can't avoid drawing
comparison to Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey (one
of Christopher Nolan's favourite films). Interstellar is indeed an
odyssey of its own, but it ultimately fails where 2001 succeeds.Before I talk about the ending, I want to comment on how good the rest
of the film was. It was amazing! Everything about it was a masterpiece:
the visual effects, the score, the imagery, the story, everything. Most
of all though, the dialogues. As I mentioned above the film also gets
philosophical at times amidst the so well-researched scientific script.
You listen to the astronauts talking about supermassive black holes and
the next moment they discuss about love being a total mystery that
overcomes the barriers of space and time. It was much more
though-provoking than I expected. The idea alone that a time may come
when earth won't have the necessary ingredients to sustain human life
is terribly frightening. The main theme of the film I think is survival
and how far people are determined to go in order to survive. What would
you do if you have to choose between the people you love and the
preservation of the human kind? I hope we never come to face this
dilemma.And then comes the the ending. This is where everything goes wrong. We
discover that the ghost and these 5-dimension beings are actually
future humans who have evolved into much more powerful beings and allow
for Cooper to send messages in the past to help the people of his age.
Then, we learn that Murph and her team managed to create a station that
can travel in space and save a lot of people, Cooper somehow is
transferred there from the black hole and Brand starts a new human
colony in the third planet. All this carefully taken care of scientific
background becomes something closer to fantasy. First of all there's
the predestination paradox we so often come across in sci-fi movies.
How did future humans survive if they needed Cooper to send these
messages to NASA? And even if there is an explanation for that as some
people claim, why didn't future humans make things a bit easier? They
could travel through time and they supposedly created the wormhole that
made the whole plan possible. Couldn't they create a wormhole next to
the earth so that everyone could be saved? Couldn't they inform people
about the best possible planet? And if NASA created a station in space
that could sustain life for thousands of people, couldn't it do the
same in the Earth saving many more? Maybe Christopher Nolan just wanted
a happy ending. Maybe he wanted to satisfy people who didn't care much
about science. For me, the last minutes only managed to ruin my
impression of the previous 2 hours.In any case Interstellar is a great and very engaging film and its
technical aspects are amazing. The ending made the plot seem a bit
faulty, but this doesn't make it a bad film. In fact I would recommend
it to everyone. You never know, maybe there is a pretty good and
scientific explanation for everything and I'm completely wrong. Maybe
this is why 2001 is better. Kubrick knew which answers he could answer
and which he could not. So instead of coming up with some out-of- place
explanations about the monolith and evolution, he just leaves
everything open for interpretation letting the movie speak for itself.
I wish Interstellar did the same.More reviews at https://reflectingoncinemablog.wordpress.com

There is no question that Interstellar is the kind of over ambitious
movie that will polarize audiences, but I'll give it credit where it is
do.A strong first act is followed by a clumsy and dull second act followed
by a climax which is enough of a mind-f**k to partially re-engage you.
This is a medium good film, but far from a great one.As far as the cast goes, Interstellar gets fair performances out of
Matthew Mcconaughey and John Lithgow. Jessica Chastain is also strong
yet strangely distant. Anne Hathoway meanwhile leaves us in the cold.
She is as bland as she was in Dark Knight Rises. Nolan as a writer
continues to have trouble delivering strong female characters.The dialogue is not the film's strong suit. It is heavy on scientific
jargon and forced sentiment and unless you are watching the film with
surround sound, almost half the conversation is inaudible. Hanz Zimmer
delivers a distinctive score but one that is so overbearing that whole
lines of script get lost behind it.The scenes in space are filmed quite admirably. This is movie where you
get lost in the cosmos rather than admiring of the CGI quality. Special
effects are not meant to be the star of the show. Interstellar sends
its characters to planets that resemble real landscapes on Earth, and
it doesn't need to dress them up or add flair to make you feel like you
are light years from home.I cannot say that Interstellar is not an endurance test, because it is.
Though not as exhausting as say the last half of Return of the King,
Interstellar is burdened by a very dull middle section with
questionable editing decisions and a waste of Matt Damon. The Climax is
highly cerebral but might leave you annoyed depending on how hard you
try to deconstruct it.The films heart is in the right place. It is an ambitious film with
some unforgettable scenes, but it won't age as well as Nolan Batman
trilogy, and is an acquired taste that won't be for everyone.

-When I first watched this movie in IMAX, I was stunned by its visuals
and pipe organ music score by Hans Zimmer. Visuals of this
movie-wormholes, black holes, waves, Mann's planet...all of these
visuals were absolutely striking and never seen before.However, after all these visuals, what made me fall in love with this
movie was its score and story. The score of Hans Zimmer, with enormous
sounds of organs and orchestra, is perfectly fitting to the theme of
space odyssey and the 'love' inside it. The story of this movie is
unique- what Cooper finds out inside black hole is the key for the
mankind's survival. However, that key is directly connected to the idea
of 'love'. Some may dislike this movie because of this part. But
connecting the most unscientific idea to the most scientific space
movie of all time was something unique and brilliant for me. Overall, a
perfect movie. 10/10.

the way it ends is far too easy. They have taken a wormhole to travel through the intergalactic space.
Cooper and Amelia could meet during this travel.Problem 1 : Cooper falling into Gargantua is taking the same path. The
entrance of the wormhole is near Saturn. The exit outside the
Gargantua's system.--> how Gargantua can be possibly connected to the worm hole ???? -->
Why after entering the Black hole, the exit is near Saturn while it is
originally the entrance of the worm hole --> if a black hole has an
entrance and an exit, then it is a worm hole. Problem 2 : 2 years to reach Saturn The size of Gargantua is estimated
about the size of the earth orbit. They are ""arriving "" quite far from
the Black hole after taking the Worm hole. --> why are they reaching the Ocean planet and Mann's planet in a
couple of minutes when it should take years for it ? --> The waves on
the Ocean planet are obviously shaped and deformed by the extreme
gravity pull from the black hole nearby.The human body is composed of
70% of water. How the hell can they keep their shape intact while waves
reach 1000 meter tall.Cooper could also be dead at this end, pushing is brain to the limit in
order to survive but if Nolan wanted us to think that, Why Murph would
be so old? Why the son is not appearing ? Why humanity would fail to
protect earth ? and above all, why cooper would imagine himself alive
near Saturn in the void of the space ! (there are better ways to
survive and better good memories...)As I said. A beautiful picture. An inaccurate science. This is a pure
Hollywood movie.

Interstellar is the most scientifically accurate movie I have ever
seen, here as usually Nolan create an incredible film about the way we
use science to go forward end combined with the determination as a
specie to survive really send us to places we can't even
imagine.Everyone plays their role perfectly and although you may don't
understand fully the science ,you more than you get the fears ,hopes
and that times desperation which our protagonist have deal with during
their adventure in the star. Do not hear the people who try to find
problems in the movie in order to make believe that it is rubbish,
because it isn't firstly and secondary every film ever made has a issue
or two but the good ones can overshadow them and be remembered funnily
and Interstellar is in this category no doubt about that.

Set in a future where crop species are going extinct one after another
former test pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer growing corn. His
daughter Murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room; Cooper doesn't
believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on
the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. He goes to that
location and finds himself at a NASA base where he learns of a secret
programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole
discovered near Saturn. He is asked to take part in a mission to find
the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole; each of which has a
scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. The plan is
to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there
is a back-up plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard
their ship. Time is an issue as it moves at a different rate near the
black hole; this means that as hours pass for Cooper years are passing
back on Earth.This film starts at a gentle pace gradually explaining what has
happened to the Earth before getting the mission to save the world
started; this means the separation of Cooper and Murphey is more
emotional. Once the mission is underway there is plenty of tension,
including some particularly gripping moments on the second planet they
visit. The small cast does a fine job; especially Matthew McConaughey,
who plays Cooper; Anne Hathaway, who plays Amelia Brand a scientist
aboard the mission; and Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain, who play
the younger and older Murphey. The effects looked great, as one would
expect in a film from Christopher Nolan, and I was pleased that space
was depicted as silent; something that is both scientifically correct
but also more impressive. Things do get a little confusing near the end
but in a way that made me want to watch again rather than causing
frustration.Overall I'd recommend this to somebody looking for intelligent science
fiction in the mould of '2001  A Space Odyssey' although this has
more emotion to it than that classic.

Christopher Nolan is my most respected filmmaker due to his crazy
dedication and authenticity, but - for the record - he also knows what
people likes, and have to admit that, he is not a big risk taker. He is
very careful with the themes and genres. Also I can't believe he made
such a superhero TRILOGY as batman, which broke box offices, and yet
Marvel is still feeding us with its crappy junk replications. I think Interstellar was the one, where he took the least risk he has
ever done, and simply went for the everything, which is hip in
filmmaking nowadays:-Post-Apocalipse -Sci-Fi -Matthew McConaughey -Time's relativity (2nd
time after Inception??) -Hans Zimmer etc. (smart kid, wormhole...)

Without a doubt one of the best films I've seen in recent years. The
imagery is amazing and the story line is so thought provoking you'll be
dying to watch it again and again and again. I was hooked right from
the start and it only became more intense the longer the movie went on.
I am thankful to be alive in a day and age where I can witness movies
such as this. Without giving anything away if you are not left
scratching your head once this is over then you are clearly a much
smarter person than I am! I would go as far as saying it is a must
watch for anyone interested enough to read this review! You will
absolutely love it.

Earth has become inhabitable in this work of Nolan-ized science
fiction, so a crew of four explorers travel through a wormhole in hopes
of finding a new place for humans to live. Over-budgeted and overlong,
but still enjoyable; unfortunately, Nolan no longer takes a complex
idea and cinematically fleshes it out, he instead takes cheap thrills
and attempts flip them into something betterhere we have the idiocy of
Armageddon trying to be flipped into the brilliance of 2001: A SPACE
ODYSSEY. Definitely has its moments, but nobody will be begging for it
not to end.**½ (out of four)

Spoiler AlertFor those of you who remember Carl Sagan's Cosmos 35 years ago you may,
like me, have guessed the plot at the beginning i.e. who was behind the
bookcase: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPoGVP-wZv8&feature=youtu.beThat aside it's a good film with some excellent effects. Matthew
McConaughey mumbles to the point where he was difficult to hear some of
the time and the point at which he is accepted willy-nilly as a pilot
for the waiting craft is painfully weak.But apart from those quibbles it was all very decent film: sort of The
Abyss meets Sixth Sense meets Gravity.

I had the good fortune to find ""Interstellar"" in a cinema here in
Milano yesterday evening in the original language, with subtitles.
That's pretty rare here: the dubbing industry remains very strong, with
skilled practitioners, and most Italians prefer to watch most films in
Italian. I did find that having the original dialogue helped a lot with
this movie, as it was not so much that the dialogue was complex, but
that it retained the emotional content and inflections of the original
actors. The titles (in Italian, of course) actually helped to keep from
losing those parts which were ""mumbled"", an issue I see increasingly in
American films. I guess it's realistic treatment to portray speaking
roles in the way people actually speak--in the opposite direction from
the hearer, asides barely heard--as opposed to declaiming theatrically.Anyway, the movie made a deep impression and gave me a lot to think
about. I am actually doing two reviews of it--this one, of a more
general nature, and one which will go into more depth about some of the
issues brought up in the climactic final hour. That one, which
necessarily has some spoilers about some of the surprising turns toward
the end of the movie, will go into a time capsule here and be released
in a few months, when the first run (and anticipated post- Oscar
continuation of that run) are over, and everyone has had the
opportunity and time to see it. I feel that is very appropriate
treatment for this movie.I make a distinction between the old-style science fiction and the
genre which has largely displaced it in recent decades, fantasy
fiction. The main difference between the two is that science fiction
should seek to place its narratives in a world we can see as a possible
one (past, present, or future). Recognition, or explanation, of
scientific understanding helps guide key aspects of the story in
directions outside our normal experience, but still possible. Fantasy
is not limited by the conventions of possible reality: instead its
authors are allowed to consider worlds that may not be possible, beings
that may never exist, and scenarios that could never realistically
occur. All fiction requires the suspension of disbelief--we need to believe,
in the case of historical fiction for example, that the dialogues and
events not historically recorded are real. Fantasy differs in that we
need to accept, temporarily, an alternate reality. I would argue that
""Interstellar"" is fantasy--a well-presented one--but one that is
contrary to what could ever be possible.To recap the premise of the story of the movie, something that has been
widely disclosed (so no spoiler here), a near-future plague is
destroying all of the world's food crops. Only corn remains, and its
continued viability is at risk. The population is already decimated and
is in the process of dying out. A possible way to continue the species
appears in the form of interstellar travel, through the fortuitous
appearance of a space-time wormhole near Saturn, to some distant
galaxies which may be able to support human life.One little problem: interstellar travel is way beyond the capability of
the human race, now and for the foreseeable future. Of course, in a
movie titled ""Interstellar"", set just a few decades in the future, this
is actually a fundamental problem. Director Christopher Nolan, who with
his brother wrote the story, goes to great lengths to provide
scientific underpinning for his fantastic construct. Some of it has
validity, while some I could recognize, even with my freshman physics
knowledge, was impossible, though mostly subtly so. I give him credit
for trying to make the workings of interstellar travel believable,
something that others--I think of ""Avatar"", the ""Aliens"" series, ""Star
Trek""--don't even attempt. This effort does contribute to the value of the entertainment, though.
What we see in ""Interstellar"" is a variety of people, people not unlike
us, in a highly-stressful situation and their human reactions and
behavior. There is emotional content, there are characters who develop
through the story, there is some study of how decisions are made under
stress, there is even philosophy. It is a human story, and a humane
one. Violence is present, but in the proper measure; love is a primary
factor. As a fantasy, it is quite a satisfying one: complex in its
presentation, plenty of food for thought during and after, and the
audio-visual aspect is all we should expect. (I might like to see it in
Imax.)I would say it sets a new standard in the genre of space fantasy for
its depth and attempt at lucidity. In that sense, it exceeds movies
like ""Gravity""--which was not fantasy but similar in its drama and some
key aspects--or ""Avatar"". I would compare it most directly to ""2001: A
Space Odyssey"" (to which it's certainly better in the lucidity aspect,
though maybe not the artistic ones) and to ""Contact"" (the Jodie Foster
movie from some 20 years ago, based on a story by Carl Sagan). Both
share with ""Interstellar"" a philosophy that man's destiny is in the
stars, but ""Interstellar"" puts a different twist on it. ""Interstellar""
has a great cast, with several big stars playing their characters (not
just themselves-- even Matthew McConnaughy, though he does bring a bit
more redneck to the role than I thought was needed)--I was particularly
tickled to see Wes Bentley (of ""American Beauty"") and Jeff Hephner (of
""Boss""). Finally, I see some parallels with another, supposedly
earth-bound, fantasy: ""The Wizard of Oz"" (however, no singing, though
the musical score was excellent).Even as a fantasy, ""Interstellar"" is hardly perfect, but to go into the
errors--in concept, and in details--would require giving away too much.
Check the time capsule in a few months. My guess for Oscar: about 8-9 nominations, including sound, music,
sets, a couple for acting, original screenplay, director, Best Picture,
and 3-4 wins.

Without giving away anything from the story of Interstellar , heres an
attempt at a review. it's a film designed at two separate levels - to begin with its
seriously intimate/ emotionally heavy and a lot of sincerity & heart
went in to this story so it makes you wanna hug your people. Secondly
its awesome in its visual capacity, lots of special effects driven
overwhelming moments.The discernible emphasis on family , especially the relationship
between parents n their children is extremely well written &
brilliantly acted out, and for me it was that positive reconciliation
of close relationships and the immeasurable distance/ time, which makes
you weigh the possibility of such a scenario inside your head .. and
its thought-provoking & profound in that sense.At the same time, it successfully leaves you in awe of its scale, and
the classic sense of gravity or lack thereof (pun intended) and also
the multivalent character of the science that it ambitiously explores &
somewhat authentically portrays. I don't know what the science is
about, I kind of got it but like its seriously complex, I'm reading up
certain Wikipedia entries at the moment. But heres the thing, you are
not meant to reconcile with that comprehension of the science, all that
scientific jargon might go over your head n you might still end up
being entertained because visually , this movie is a realistic and
well-thought and responsibly written tribute to your imagination which
has intrigued you at Space, galaxies n whatever.Since its three hours long, and considering the particular nature of
Chris Nolan as a director and his intentions, it was pretty obvious to
me after watching it that he and his writers split this film into three
parts , beginning at the individual /family level, then going on to the
structural level , where the film offers education and everyone is
still acting cool and from that second stage onwards they went even
further, to the point of remaining last hour n half, the 3rd act, which
sees the ##$ really hit the fan. one can only properly enjoy this
stuff when its seen at the cinema.Soundtrack was not bad, but it could've been better. it would've been a
perfect film if Anne Hathaway wasn't in it, it's not her character
thats painful to watch, its her effort at her crispy , polite manner of
speaking, which is why her performance was the weak link , but overall
its a beautifully crafted film with a solid cast, more humour than you
might expect so hope you enjoy it.
"

My very best favorite film. Incredibly I couldn't believe, I was
skeptical to the idea that Nolan could offer me a more enjoyable piece
of cinema than Inception, that wonder that left me in awe and
fascinated a few years earlier. But Christopher nailed it. Watching
Interstellar upon its release was for me an experience hard to
describe, that special kind of thing that you know is a rare gift, and
does't come very often. It's the perfect balance between intellect and
emotion. Around many terms of advanced physics such as black holes,
distant stars, wormholes, interstellar travel, etc; we come across a
heart touching story about a father and his daughter, forced to be
separated and the odyssey that involves their most improbable reunion.Definitely a must-see, a story that will transcend space and time.And always remember: don't go gentle into that good night...

This review is chiefly about the music. Zimmer's score is one of the
outstanding film scores of the past 50 years and suits the story line
very well. Noland in part is responsible for the fine quality of this
score because he gave Zimmer extra time to work on the score which most
producers do not do--they had the film over and say--I need the music
ready to use in a week---which often results in hackwork instead of
music that enhances the quality of the film. The style of music seeks to combined electronic music with traditional
orchestra and solo instruments and seems to borrow some or most of its
style from America's noted composer Phillip Glass in its fine art music
style.The scoring./Orchestration is rather unusual calling for a real Organ,
Electronic instruments, Steel Guitar, Violin Solo. IT is not often that
the Organ is scored for in film music--there is SECONDS the BOX OFFICE
flop that Rock Hudson starred in that had a fake Organ.Then the next
notable usage is in 20001 in which Ligeti's Volumina (unfortunately
often edited out in some videos and cds fo the track music) and Richard
Strauss's Thus Spake Zarathustra scores are used.This film introduces the theories of String Theory in which states
there are more dimensions than than three based on Einstein's equations
relating to Relativity. This concept is rather difficult to understand
without proper introduction to it. PBS NOVA had a program to explain
this and the reader is strongly advised to consult this video which can
be gotten by calling them up and ordering. Noland had some of the worlds best advise on this film especially that
of Kip Thorne who in some versions of the video is given credit but it
seems not on this site.This film is one of the masterworks of film production but just how
great it is only the future will tell if it is still being watched 50
years from now to if the film is rather trite and crude (as the Ian
Fleming's GOLDFINGER now seems after 50 years or it survives like da
Vinci's Mona Lisa.

Ambicious movie, great acting, and a robot. What you need more?
Science? OK, there is a LOT of Science, and even if you're not a
scientist or just don't know much about it, it's OK, because the way
the director put physics is incredible easy to understand.This movie have something that I didn't notice in a long time in other
movies, the capacity of making me think how we handle things around us.
And there is a lot of things to be adapted to in this movie. The great
force of the nature is the greatest of them. This plot was developed so
well that even in a world were we are going out of supplies, there is
room for hope.The acting is another big pro of this movie, it can make you laugh and
cry in a second. The synergy between the actors is evident.The sound track and the CGI are stunning, together they make you
paralyze in front of the screen and wait to something happen, or not.Finally, it is a great movie, a movie that I was missing

I will always remember seeing Interstellar at the cinema for the first
time in IMAX. In fact, I would easily pay more than £50 to go and see
it again in IMAX, and easily over £300 to have my memory wiped and see
it again for the first time.Christopher and Jonathan Nolan have nothing to prove, but they've shown
just how incredibly talented they are with Interstellar.The music: Hans Zimmmer. Hans Zimmer is a genius. The score he wrote
for this film is outstanding. It will make you cry, smile, give you
goosebumps. I am baffled he didn't win the Oscar for his work on this
film (despite how highly I rate The Grand Budapest Hotel and Desplat). The cinematography: This what many people will go and see the film for.
It is a Nolan epic, so you'll be expecting big things after seeing
Inception. You will not be disappointed. It really is a work of art,
the visuals are out of this world (quite literally). The physics: To some people, myself included, I want films to be
possible, to not be based on laws of physics that do not exist. As Kip
Thorne, a physicist, was consulted to apply his theories to the film,
and discourage the use of the impossible features found in many sci- fi
films, Interstellar is as accurate as our science and discoveries have
allowed it to be, to this day. The story: I get tired of the word 'genius', because it should only be
used when its necessary. It is necessary. The thrilling plot of
interstellar space travel balanced perfectly with the well-built and
structured relationships between characters makes Interstellar a
classic.The acting: Every character's acting is magnificent (apart from Anne
Hathaway's). A special mention to Matthew McConaughey, Mackenzie Foy
and Jessica Chastain who ooze emotion and feeling throughout. After seeing Interstellar, you'll be puzzled, dumbfounded and shocked
to find yourself wondering how Nolan changed your life in an evening,
through a screen.

Besides trilogies (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, etc.), I put standalones
in their own category.This movie has definite possibilities of a sequel, but I don't think it
needs to. It stands completely on its own, and as for those types of
movies, this is the best one I have ever seen.Without giving anything away, the logic, combined with real-life
theoretical physics, such as gravitational time-dilation (look it up
online), makes for a truly new and thought-provoking concept.Before this movie, I never thought about these types of endless
possibilities and the repercussions they could have.Even if you are not into science, or science fiction, you will love
this movie, even if parts of it go over your head (though they do a
fantastic job explaining details of the theories, etc.).Space......the final frontier....?

Spoiler Free! Having seen many of the sci-fi movies to date including
2001, Alien, Star Wars, ect.(2015) this movie by far is the best at
depicting humanities future in a positive light. Well worth watching
for so many reasons, though for those who have a hard time wrapping
their heads around Eisenstein's E=MC2, it's going to be difficult to
understand but great to watch and enjoy. This movie not only hits every
subject of astronomical physics known to modern humankind, but expands
upon how we hope to achieve our life beyond the earth. Interstellar is
the greatest representation of our future as humankind since 2001: A
Space Odyssey.
"
188,7,"
This movie, Interstellar was a great movie about a family of scientists
who try to save the world and actually do. The story seemed to be a
constant battle, always ending on a good note. The special effects of
the black hole and a few of the planets was sensational. The story-line
and dialogue was kept very simple and followed a very clear logical
storyboard. This seemed to compel the audience and mesmerize them.
Almost like being in a trance. While I sat in the IMAX movie theater in
Victoria City - the whole theater with people was full and not a person
moved from their seats throughout the duration of the whole movie.
Furthermore, the whole audience was quiet and listened closely to the
dialogue of the movie. The whole movie was captivating. I liked the
simple space ships, and outfits that the space travelers wore. I also
like the overall simplicity of the exploration of space. The space
ships were small, the packages of left data in orange bags in the ocean
were easy to be identified and everything seemed very functional and
practical. This felt safe. This movie seems to have been a symbol of
our future. One of simplicity externally and complexity internally. I
also liked the fact that aliens were not introduced into this movie -
but rather the notion of the evolved human being, being able to
communicate and through new dimensions. It was a positive and happy
movie about a hopeful future. One of change and one of humanity.

quiet a while and an ex-NASA pilot has stumbled into a secret NASA ""war

don't they just send a few saucers down to meet with the Secretary of
Agriculture, and leave them a disk with all the instructions on how to
turn it all around? > Space is great, but why not make it simple? very
interesting Science is also presented, though > our Hero must deal with
the reality that when he returns to Earth, his Daughter is 42 and so is
he. he finds other more serious challenges, however, while en

create any detours to throw his ""schedule"" off course? Michael caine,
Ellen Burstyn, and JOhn Lithgrow are the only actors I recognize..oh
yeah..the quiet dude from the Lincoln commercials. He is as expressive
in this 2 .5 hr. epic as he is staring straight ahead, in a more
mundane form of transportation. The only bad acting job here is by the star. When he finally cracks a
smile, the Gentleman Quarterly stud looks like Soupy Sales. (not a bad
thing). All the rest of the cast is just fine. I hope their checks
cleared.

I'm a big fan of Christoper Nolan. His directing, and co-writing the
screenplay with Thomas Nolan, sucked me in like I was on the event
horizon of a black hole. While at times it was profoundly moving about
the meanings of our lives and of the nature of time itself, it left me
disappointed compared to masterpieces like 'Memento', the Dark Knight
trilogy, and 'Inception'. I wasn't very impressed with Hans Zimmer's
score (I was given high expectations.) The effects were, however,
fantastic, better than I could have expected. If I remember correctly,
it was Jessica Chastain's character who said that 'recursion is
pointless.' Sorry if I got that wrong, gang, but the denouement of this
picture is the very definition of recursion as stated earlier in the
picture. I wasn't dissatisfied with 'Interstellar', but I left feeling
rather let down that Nolan's effort wasn't the mind-blowing spectacle
that other IMDb members said it was.
"
191,8,"
OK so this was my most anticipated films of the year and with films
like the dark knight and inception under Nolan's belt expectations were
very high. Ill start of by saying that this isn't the masterpiece i
thought it would be however it is still a great film. First of all the
acting is great especially from Matthew mcchaunoughhay as well as the
little girl who played his daughter she was also really good in the
movie. The relationship between this father and daughter was one of the
high points of this movie however i feel that the resolution between
the to fell a bit flat without getting into spoilers. The supporting
cast was also really good including greats like Anne Hathaway Jessica
chasten and Michael Caine. Casey affleck was also really good however i
felt that his character was really unnecessary and i feel that the film
could of happened without that character completely. And yes this film
is very confusing and the ending may make your head explode and people
are going to be talking about it for years to come. The theory's that
Nolan tackles in this movie were really fascinating to me however i
really felt that some things were not fully explored. I could talk
about this film for hours but the fact is i would definitely recommend
this movie just for the visual experience. SCORE- 8/10
"
192,8,"
Christopher Nolan and CO have done it again: this is undoubtedly the
event movie of the year. Hyped, magnificent to behold, brazen,
emotional and filled with ideas. For all that though, and despite its
many qualities, it is closer to The Dark Knight Rises than it is to
Inception.First, the good, and - lucky us - that means ""great"": McConnaughy
effortlessly anchors this sprawling cosmic story and makes you care
every inch of the way, without being too perfect a hero. Visually this
is often a feast without being suffocating, due in no small part to a
very clever camera-anchoring aesthetic which makes the space scenes
both breathtaking and believable. You believe you are watching NASA
footage of the future. Special mention to Matt Damon and Anne Hathaway,
whose characters might have come across as silly caricatures in lesser
hands. Emotionally too, this is an often touching, sometimes
heartbreaking film.What really seems to strike a cord with audiences around the world, is
how the film tackles the mind-bending issues of relativity and our
insignificance as a species, while never losing track of its emotional
core. To its credit it chooses to focus very intently on the idea that
what is best for an individual and what is best for a species as a
whole can be very strongly opposed. The film harks back to 2001 and Solaris (two very different films) in
some of the ideas it addresses, but manages to have more humanity than
the former, and more scope than the latter. In fact, in warning us of
our folly and celebrating our ingenuity in times of desperation, it
manages to have its cake and eat it to. No mean feat, and all the more
satisfying an experience for it.Now, for the bad, and perhaps this takes multiple viewings to sink in:
cleverly crafted as the film is, this comes more as an afterthought. If
one chooses to scratch a bit beneath the surface, there are glaring
plot and logic holes (one involving an obviously doomed choice of
planet, the other a classic chicken/egg time travel paradox which is
unfortunately central to the plot). You could look past these and even
explain them away, but they could easily have been addressed, as well
as one or two incredibly stupid things Nolan makes his characters say
and do. Hans Zimmer's score is also at times overbearing and awkwardly
loud in the mix, making one wonder what this could have been in the
hands of someone like James Newton Howard or even Philip Glass.Anyone who has read Yukinobu Hoshino's peerless ""2001 Nights"" manga
will have already seen many of the same ideas and settings explored
better elsewhere, and perhaps that is partially the point, to fan the
flame of curiosity, and get people to seek such sources out. A
blockbuster that can make you both alarmed and proud as a species,
while making you thirst for more about quantum physics, cosmology and
the possibility of space travel deserves every accolade it gets.This is not the flawless masterpiece many would have you believe, but
it touches brilliance more than once, and its rewards are immense. As
an event movie, particularly in an age of dull sequels, this is so much
more than we could hope for!
"

I like the movie. Very drama filled and flowing with suspense until the
end. A twist of almost pure fantasy for a movie like this.It's
basically a suspense filled drama flick with a science fiction theme.
It Starts out slow with a growing sense of despair. It builds up
nicely. Some of it's pure unreal, or pure fantasy situations, like the
ghost, should go unanswered. It destroys the mood of the movie. The
worse part is at the end, with very unrealistic situations. I give it a
six if you like tense movies., and voyages into the unknown if you
don't mind a little nonsense thrown in. A fairly good movie with some
minor credibility issues.

I was waiting for more than a year after I heard that Nolan was
attached to the project and I was kind of 'scared' that the film
wouldn't meet my expectations, especially after reading the early
critics, but it did. I think i've never felt so small watching a movie
!!Interstellar has so much depth in so many levels. I like the fact that
Nolan managed to make an emotional film about space exploration.
Visuals were stunning and I definitely think i'll go and watch again on
the iMax, especially because this one is not 3D (not a big fan of 3D,
it takes away the work of the cinematographer in some cases).I've always been a huge fan of Nolan, I would say that Memento and The
Dark Knight are in my top 10, and I think this movie brought what I
love most about him. The Dark Knight Rises and Inception were close to
masterpiece but something was missing for me. Interstellar is
definitely a movie that would change things. I'm also a huge fan of
space exploration so this combined with well directed drama, solid
cast, beautiful score and monumental visuals did it for me !!Don't hesitate, go and see it and be part of an exceptional journey !!

Soo opening the back door of the NASA conference room, within 3 feet
they find themselves with a huge smoking inter-galactic rocket ready
for launch? come on. Plus tones of scientific mambo jumbo, with unrelated ""mathematical
equations"" on blackboard (they are still using blackboards 2 centuries
from now? laptops anyone?). The old genius professor, the young
attractive scientist woman, the emotional cowboy hero .. are you really
comparing this to 2001 space odyssey .. and on top of all one
dimensional acting, no character development..From the guy that did Inception I would have hoped for little more..
maybe it's the bad acting, maybe it's the overwhelming topic, maybe
it's the amazing Kubrick's 2001 already out there decades before..
donno.HAL open the pod bay doors please, this time for real, I need to get
out!

First things first, it is not a bad movie. However, we need to evaluate
on the promise - it was hyped and marketed as a science fiction done
proper, a genre-redefining proposition. It just is not. The same sad
feeling I had for Cuaron's ""Gravity"", where we justify the movie not by
how good it was but how bad it avoided to be.Plotwise, it is a try to merge and recreate both Kubrick's ""2001"" and
Zemeckis' ""Contact"", bot masterpieces of its' own times. This is not a
bad thing in my opinion, both were bold movies with big but ultimately
separate themes. Trying to put loneliness of space travel, a critical
view of society and mysteries of yet undiscovered science all in one
movie could have resulted in something great. Something that for
example ""Sunshine"" and ""Moon"" missed for being too small in scope.Unfortunately for Nolan, a tale needs to be told through dialog and
narration and that is where Interstellar's stellar cast fails.
McConaughey as Cooper is perhaps his greatest ever, conveying some
great emotion and unusual attitude for blockbuster lead. Contrary to
many other opinions, I find Anne Hathaway equally brilliant, but even
more an example of first failure of this movie - the lines these two
are given are shallow and often nonsensical. Hathaway's Dr. Brand is
acted with such an emotion and such genuine expression that I remain
baffled how she was given less then 100 lines to say. I was constantly
under impression that her face screams for an opportunity to open up to
us, and let's not forget that her tragedy is perhaps greater then
Cooper's.Which brings me to think about what would make a great science fiction
movie, and if it's even possible to do it today.1) Do not mock (established) science in science fiction. It has
""science"" in it's name for a reason. Oh, I have no problems with flying
over accretion disks, falling into black holes or improbable planetary
arrangements - it is all a realm of theories, well researched but
ultimately not yet experienced. In that sense, there could have been
dragons inside the black hole and I'd be OK with that. But to have a
three stage rocket necessary to leave earth and then just fly off other
planets in what is essentially an airplane is just ridiculous. There
are many similar errors in the movie.2) There is no need to state the obvious throughout the entire movie.
There is no need for a character to say ""I'm pressing this button"" - I
can clearly see you are pressing it. Over 75% of all communication is
non-verbal, I think filmmakers need to stop worrying that something
would not be understood if it's not spelled out.3) I'd love to see a psychiatric eval of characters in Interstellar.
Why is it that humanity's brightest need to act as disordered
psychopaths in order to have ""character"".4) Do not betray your own premise. Interstellar is a movie much more
about loss and grief then space travel. And even that's OK. But why,
why did you need to put a ravaged and beaten main character in a
position where he could change the past and avoid what he is lamenting
the entire movie. Even that could have been a great moment where he
could have understood the meaning and necessity of his suffering.
Instead he repeats actions that set the entire plot in motion and seals
his fate again, while screaming through tears that he does not want
this fate. Like his brain and hands somehow became disconnected.Oh, the robots were a total upside. Such a novel take on AI, loved
every line and every scene.A 6/10 for obvious incredible effort.

While I was watching ""Interstellar"" I kept thinking about Matthew
McConaughey's character of Wooderson from ""Dazed and Confused"" mainly
because I watched it right before I saw ""Interstellar."" I could not
take his character Cooper seriously at first because I could not stop
thinking about his stoner counterpart. This was before I saw any of
McConaughey's previous triumphs so I was not fully engaged in the
McConaissance. McConaughey has proved his acting skills and has really
developed into a serious and respectable actor. His performance in
""Interstellar"" was stellar after of course I got over his whole
Wooderson thing.Now let me actually start talking about the movie. I thought it was
great. I was never bored with it and I was very intrigued to find out
where this adventure was going. Though I admit some of the story was
overcomplicated especially the science behind it all but after multiple
viewings you start to understand it better just like Nolan's previous
films like ""The Prestige"" and ""Inception."" This movie did not
disappoint and after watching it the film stuck with me and I found
myself thinking about it a lot. Overall, this film is a sci-fi
masterpiece.I love Christopher Nolan films and he is one of the few directors out
there that has consistently made good movies and he is a director that
you can rely on. I think the man is a genius. He has the ability to
produce pictures that will immerse the audience from start to finish in
the worlds that he creates. Also to mention that his films make bank. I
am a huge fan of his practical effects as well, which look great in all
his movies.""Interstellar"" is another great film from Chirstopher Nolan. He really
knows how to bring the best out of his actors. The performances in
""Interstellar"" were really good. The score from frequent collaborator
Hans Zimmer was fantastic and really made the movie more impactful. The
visual effects I thought were amazing and were well deserving of the
Oscar. I was very intrigued by all of the scientific anomalies present
in the film and really sparked an interest in space which I have never
been big on. In closing, ""Interstellar"" is a classic sci-fi masterpiece that I think
most will like and respect for its one of a kind type of movie. The
originality of this movie is insane. (In a good way of course)

Penned by Nolan brothers, here came an amazing Sci-Fi thriller.It is a
masterpiece from Christopher Nolan, a well-renowned director for his
movies like Dark knight and Inception.For a common man, the plot just
seems to be very complex, as one has to know the basics related to
Space science.The movie may seem a little boring at the beginning, but
as the movie gets progressed, It will be very interesting.Screenplay
and Background music elevates the movie far enough.Other visual aspects
are also Top notch.Many critics have applauded the movie while the
others have criticized that it reminds them the movies like Apollo and
space odyssey.Many thanks to Christopher Nolan for having given us such
an incredible movie.My rating for this movie can only be a 10 because,
in itself, It is a beginning for a new kind of cinema.A sheer brilliant
feat of cinema for the 21st century.
"
199,8,"
Do you remember when Chris Nolan wasn't CHRIS NOLAN!! Batman Begins and
The Dark Knight were amazing examples of redefining old material and
creating a world as profoundly unique as Tim Burton did in the 90's.
Memento and Inception are two of the smartest, most profound films I
have ever seen. But what happened with the Dark Knight Trilogy is Nolan
had been stroked so much that he thinks he can do anything. He thinks
everything he touches is gold and that isn't quite true. Now all that
being said I am so completely confused as to whether Interstellar is
yet another example of his sheer brilliance as a film maker and
creative mind or if its just him thinking he's great and carbon copying
other material to make some sort of deeply profound sci-fi films. It
did definitely have some plot holes (though not nearly to the extent of
The Dark Knight Rises or Man Of Steel) but a lot of that can be
explained away using hypothetical science. It is not exactly your
typical mainstream sci-fi film because it is definitely thought
provoking but then you think about it too much and the film starts to
lose merit. The characters for the most part are surface deep and while
the film is visually stunning (as far as I'm concerned its ten times
the over-hyped Gravity was visually and story wise) the story makes
sense and goes from being a little out there to total science
fiction/hypothetical physics.) There is a lot to like about
Interstellar and to call it epic is an understatement. Nolan inflates
his content to the point where there is so much good and so much bad
that you're left confused as to whether you loved it or hated it so I
think most people want to love it.Who is a hotter star right now than Matthew McConaughey? Not many! I
wouldn't call him my favourite actor by any means but I definitely
enjoy him. He has an undeniable star quality on screen. Many reviewers
call his performance as brilliant mind/astronaut turned farmer a little
laid back and perhaps it is. Does that bother me? No. He still gives a
very emotionally charged performance and he is believable in his role.
He is a commanding presence and he is good at it. Although some
reviewers speak highly of her performance I was a little disappointed
with Anne Hathaway...only a little. She is certainly one of my
favourite actors and as many have pointed out she is very emotional in
this film. She cries...a lot. She is believable in her role and she is
very stoic and almost brooding at times but she has reason to be and
like McConaughey she just has this amazing chemistry on screen. The two
of them together are okay. Its not a romantic relationship which is
fine but I think I still expected just a little more chemistry between
them. Mackenzie Foy is brilliant as the young daughter ""Murph."" Her
brief scenes are some of the best and she is really great at it. The
supporting cast are all decent including the always amazing John
Lithgow, Michael Caine (who was okay in his role but a far step down
from his usual gravitas performances), Casey Affleck (a character that
was left very underdeveloped in the big picture...and another
supporting role by a surprise actor who I had no idea was in the film.
Don't look!! Don't find out unless you already have because its kind of
a nice surprise and in today's day and age you don't get a lot of
surprises. He is also quite good in a very different role for him. And
Jessica Chastain...oh my evil little nemesis. I can't stand her. Her
entire persona in any film drives me insane. I don't know what it is.
Her look, her voice, her acting...literally my most hated star in
Hollywood. And yet critics rave about her every time and they do the
same in this. Well I can say without too much bias that she was
actually okay in this. There I said it. Believe it or not. She is
tolerable and gives a decent performance. She doesn't have a huge role
but she shows the proper range for the part. I also give hats off to
Nolan and his team for bringing Tars and Case to life...the two robotic
entities that are major players in the story. Both of them are terrific
and add a little bit of appropriate humour, some great action and are
sure to be memorable by future generations as much as other famous
robots.I'm not sure I've ever seen Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and
yet as I was watching this I felt like that was exactly what he was
channelling/copying. Maybe that's okay but it just really kept
reminding me of that and Nolan deserves to be known for his own style
and world. I would have also liked some more depth to the world that
they lived in and what was happening to the earth. My biggest beef with
the film though is how it ends. Yes it wraps up nicely and everything
makes sense and its not ambiguous like Inception was but there was a
glaring plot hole to me. After everything they go through out there in
space...they learn nothing. There is no information that they bring
back and give to earth. So how do they ""save"" humanity? Just a thought
to ponder. The truth of the matter is I wasn't disappointed. It was
thought provoking, visually impressive, beautifully made...perhaps a
little (or a lot) more melodramatic than it needed to be but it is what
it is. Fans of smart science fiction will love it and the rest of the
world will like it or hate it or be somewhere in the middle. It wasn't
an Oscar contender for me but I'm glad I saw it. 8/10

Great visuals. Great acting. Some good science. Some ridiculous
science. Very squirrelly ending. Matthew McConaughey is terrific. The
movie kept my interest but I kept thinking I was watching a movie that
was trying to do too much. Contact meets 2001: A Space Odyssey meets M.
Night Shyamalan. I was fascinated by the concept of the movie...dying
Earth and the decision to save humanity versus stay with your
kids...but it just did not totally hang together for me. Toward the end
of the movie the science gets shakier and shakier until the ending
comes along and I felt cheated. I love Christopher Nolan's work. I just
felt like this visually beautiful and well acted movie went on too long
and then tied it all up way too neatly at the end.
"
201,6,"
This nearly 3 hour movie for me was just that. The first hour of the
movie, gave me the sense of watching the first hour of M.Night
Shymalan's movie ""Signs"". The setting of it all, even the fields of
crop. The second hour turned out for me to be Cuaron's ""Gravity"". I
don't know if I'm been over critical, but sitting watching the movie,
that is exactly how I felt. So much, i couldn't concentrate on the
plot, but focus on me trying to find all the finds a like from both
movies. For the final hour, It was for me, the last hour of Cameron's
movie ""The Abyss"". Christopher Nolans is a great director. The movie is
average for my taste. I guess I expected more, from his great films of
Batman, my hopes where really up. Its not a bad movie, but it is one of
those movies you would want to see a Sunday when you are completely
relaxed and have free time to burn and just sit back and don't want to
think about anything. I give it a 6 out of 10.

Kudos to the PR firm that doused IMDb with a ludicrously high rating to
get more fans to go to his movie than they should. But now, let's get
real about this movie ...The Good: The story has a unique storyline that is imaginative,
engaging and touching. That's likely why people walk away from the
movie feeling better about the movie than you might expect. The story
does everything from tug at your heart with an emotional parent/child
separation to exercise your brain with quantum mechanics, physics and
science. The acting is first rate and the characters are fairly well
developed. The musical score and effects are also world class. The
movie is polished, moving and creative.The Bad: Where do I begin? While the story is unique and creative, it
has enough holes in it to fill a donut shop. The writers want us to
believe that ""evolved humans of the future"" choose to communicate with
those of us in the past through Morse code. Hmmn. OK. They want us to
ignore that the main character had to first find the NASA station in
order to send the coordinates back to himself. But wait, if he already
knew the coordinates then why would he need to send them back?
Chicken/egg dilemma of time-related scripts. We must believe that
someone can go into a black hole ... yes the (supposedly) most powerful
force in the universe and yet conveniently be transported from the
black hole to a worm hole close by Saturn. Funny how that all worked
out. I could go on, but why? You mix is all together and you get a movie that is 6-7 stars. No even
close to the ""brilliance"" the PR guys published. But, a solid movie
worth seeing if you like sci-fi.IMO, Contact was better. This is another Mcconaughey movie that deals
with the same genre, but the script is less tight. Both movies were
moving. Both dealt with father/daughter separation. Both dealt with
interstellar travel, worm holes, Relativity, etc. Both tugged at your
heart. Contact was just better written.
"
203,1,"
Complete crap!! Christopher Nolan is the most over-rated director in
Hollywood!!!I only watched it because I have just seen Matthew Mcconaughey in
Dallas Buyers Club where he was fantastic. He was good in this too....But the movie sucks ass and balls!!It is no masterpiece!! Strap in for
2 hours and 49 minutes where nothing happens.""SPOILER AHEAD"" Farmer and some astronauts goes into space to save his
kids and the people on earth because our planet is dying and people are
starving. Because of hyper-sleep and a black hole and some other
nonsense they spend 84 years in another galaxy, looking for a new
planet that the human race can populate. They don't age at all because
of hyper-sleep and because time is different.Then they find Matt Damon, who was send out there to find a new home
for humans. For no reason at all Damon's character is a bad-guy,
because maybe Nolan at this point realized something had to happen
after 90 minutes of boredom. Damon tries to kill Matthew the farmer and
escape in their spaceship but accidentally kills himself. Oh and two of
the other good guy astronauts are killed.More boring crap happens and Matthew wakes up at a space-station, now
124 years old, but physically only 40, like when he left. He sees his
daughter on her death bed and goes back into the black hole or whatever
to find the always annoying Anne Hathaway (the only other surviving
astronaut) who found the planet the human race needs to survive.The end.Save yourself the torture and avoid this stinking turd. It makes the
boring Inception seem like a good movie.Apart from nice visual effects, some taken directly from Inception,
this is Nolans worst movie so far.I just hope Hollywood will wake up and realize Nolan had ONE good movie
in him: ""The Dark Knight"" and stop green-lighting his pretentious
over-bloated crap.I quote Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park 1 to sum up this movie: That is
one big pile of sh*t!!

This movie is so far beyond stupid I have no words. It is comically bad
while trying to be deep, insightful or intelligent.Do NOT waste your time. If you do attempt this movie, check your brain
at the door, but I still don't think that will help.Don't say I didn't warn you.Matthew McConnaughy is dreadful. He mumbles every line and speaks as if
he is talking to himself under his breathe.The brief segment with Matt Damon was the only reasonable part of the
movie.Again, 3 hours you will never get back.

This movie was a supreme letdown. It was overly long with dragged out scenes.That it had some good actors is about the only redeeming aspect to it.
Matthew McConaughey was superb as always but the movie wasted his
talents. Mackenzie Foy as young Murph also was great. It had a good
cast of essentially walkons which helped the movie.Interstellar should have been cut down by at least 30 minutes.The photography was brilliant but it was overloaded with special
effects, and superfluous scenes reigned supreme in this flick.A total waste of time. Interstellar was more uninterestedstellar to me.

I hated this movie-I hated this movie--Shill Reviewers Warning This
movie has obviously paid people to give it good ratings. I speak for a

2 minutes then it takes a space ship 5 minutes to get to them at
1000mph...Why did wats his name and ann warn Matt not to dock 5 times
with telling him why?? Why could he not dock??? Why did they risk the
ride home by not telling Damen why not to dock...Why did they just not
go to saturn first,,,,why was the entire trip turned out to be a hoax
when Annn ends up on a planet somewhere.. Why was it so easy for mathew
to steal a ship[ at the end, only one guy watching it. We hated this

I had huge expectations of this movie. But this movie wastes the
audience's time. its frickin 3 hours long!!! It wastes too much screen
time in getting to the point and focuses far too much time on the rural
life of Cooper (McConaughey's character) and his relationship with his
two children. Furthermore this movie makes illogical leaps that don't
make any sense and are frankly annoying.Here's one: Food crisis on earth. So, instead of figuring out ways to
grow weather resistant crops or hydroponics or anything like that -
they make the leap of completely abandoning ship to the extent of
finding another planet to live on! The science is interesting - about traveling through a rift in space -
time (worm hole) to travel to other galaxies to explore viable
alternatives to planet earth. Going into a deep frozen sleep of sorts
(similar to the original Alien) to preserve the body for the long
interstellar travel.The movie uses the idea of time travel in a way that the future and
past co-exist together and impact each other - like - Murph's Morse
code warnings that suggested Cooper shouldn't have embarked on the
mission to begin with.This movie is about coming full circle and realizing that you shouldn't
have done anything at all. Yea.. i know. Not very inspiring.The movie isn't very original either borrowing concepts from already
released and icon scifi movie and television like Star Trek, Alien,
Carl Sagan's Cosmos, Back to the Future, etc. to name a few.
"
208,1,"
Did I see the same movie that many other people gave a ten vote??
Probably not...... The movie doesn't give any logic explanation to
anything. Everything in the movie is treated in the most superficial
possible way. To not get completely disappointed all through the movie
you would need to switch off your brain completely otherwise you won't
get any answers to the questions that necessarily come to your mind.
Also great actors like Matthew McConaughey are acting awfully, probably
realizing they are acting in a dumb movie. All the Director is trying
to do is excite the audience with the soundtrack and special effects,
probably realizing himself how poor the plot is. How could so many good
actors accept to work in such a poor movie? And how come so many
critics are writing that this is a great movie? I would really like to
know what great directors like Scorsese, Di Palma, Herzog, Spielberg
would think about this movie. In two words: absolutely disappointing.
"

During the last ten years, Christopher Nolan has given himself a
notable name as a great director. Known for his intense action,
profound themes and great thriller feel that alters between the
physical and psychological, it's no wonder why his films strike a chord
with many moviegoers, myself included.This one, however, is a more of a mixed bag. The idea itself of
humanity leaving Earth to find a better planet to live has potential
for some creativity, heavy drama and intensity, with the latter two
being staples in Nolan's films. The story starts well with
well-established characters; the relationship between Cooper and Murphy
is pretty believable, as well as the latter one's development from an
emotional little girl to a responsible adult woman capable of helping
to save the earth. Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway play their roles
well too, just as they did in The Dark Knight series. The
cinematography is also gorgeous, with less plastic-looking CGI and more
shots that really make you feel like that you are in space.Still, the movie's flaws are a bit too notable to not pay attention to.
Throughout the movie, it feels like Nolan's explaining too much of the
story through exposition, while he doesn't need to. The themes present
are not hard to see for the viewer, they don't need to be spoon-fed to
them. Even though Nolan has done this before in his superior movies,
like Inception and The Dark Knight, Interstellar is the kind of story
that seems to require it less. If anything, the movie would work a lot
better if it went the same direction as Kubrick's masterpiece 2001. The
script also meanders in the middle of the story, with Matt Damon's
unnecessary addition to it and the rushed path to the ending, which
would've worked better with more buildup to who the ""They"" actually
were and how they worked.Overall, the movie is not bad, but it's not comparable to Nolan's
previous works, excluding the disappointing Man of Steel. There's a lot
in there which works, but there's something also that leaves a lot to
be desired. Still, I highly recommend this to any fan of Christopher
Nolan or scifi in general.
"
210,5,"
After INCEPTION and the awful THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, my expectations
for Christopher Nolan's new science fantasy film were low. And at 169
minutes, INTERSTELLAR is a bloated mess, with a few breathtaking
visuals and ambitious concepts thrown into the mix.Nolan has become one of those A-list directors who thinks that every
idea he has while cutting his toe nails somehow reveals a Deep Insight
About The Human Condition that must be expanded into a movie. Merged
from two screenplays, the story is full of plot holes and characters
who do stupid things. Some key elements are not explained at all.To his credit, Nolan hired astrophysicist Kip Thorne to advise him
about wormholes and black holes. It's the futuristic space elements
that kept me awake between stretches of tedious melodrama delivered by
various ""name"" actors. I actually liked the quirky robots more than the
people in this movie. By design or accident, INTERSTELLAR has a strong
1970s sensibility. Think SILENT RUNNING, PHASE IV, SOLARIS, SOYLENT
GREEN, and BLAKE'S 7. There's just too much of Disney's THE BLACK HOLE
and not enough of what Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke did so well
in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.Ultimately, the cringe-worthy ending shows that Nolan was just making
it up as he went along. Let me say that if you liked PRO-MEH-THEUS and
INCEPTION, you should enjoy INTERSTELLAR. Otherwise, proceed with
caution.

WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERSThere are so many things wrong with this film. People land on a water
planet with an ocean 1 foot deep, and get hit by a 300 foot tidal wave.
Huh?They need huge chemical booster rockets to escape Earths gravity, but
launch effortlessly from a planet with greater gravity.The whole dying Earth thing makes no sense at all. If dust were
destroying all the farms, I imagine, we would start building dust free
greenhouses.None of the science makes sense in this film. It is a shame that there
are so many people being paid to write fake reviews.The only reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating, is that I kinda
liked the robot.Since I dished out so much money for the Blue Ray, I felt that I had to
watch the whole thing. But I was praying for this crapfest of a film to
end. Don't waste your time on it.
"
212,1,"
This sci-fi flick takes place in the future by 35 years or so, but
spends almost no time developing the factors that have lead to an
atmospheric crisis (hypoxia) which posits the end of humanity. The
movie uses dust storms to convey a sense of doom, even though there is
no connection with the nitrogen/oxygen ratio. I have a hard time with
scifi where at times they seem to be guided strongly by technical
advisors (hacking into the UAV, the rotating 1-g mothership), and then
veer into fictional excess (wormholes, star-wars maneuvering in outer
space, escaping a black hole's g-field, time reversal). Good scifi can
take a single imaginary premise and run the narrative with it (Rod
Serling-style), but this story looks like it was flirting with the
impossible at too many junctures, and then using the first thing that
came to mind to blow past it. The story line became incomprehensible
towards the end, after Coop separates from the mothership and goes into
the black hole.My biggest criticism of the film is the story framework -- building up
the escapist fantasy of befouling the Earth and then colonizing another
planet. Given that 99% of people do not want to give up comforts or
economic growth to assure the habitability of their only host-planet
(the one they evolved to be compatible with over a 1-2 billion year
process), audiences are given aid and comfort in their destructive
escapism by artworks such as Interstellar. It is a cruel, irresponsible
exercise in denial to suggest for a moment that the Earth can be
""replaced"". This movie panders to the ultimate false hope - - depicting
a survival scenario where Earth as life-support system is devalued,
destroyed and discarded. I thought great art was about confronting reality, not helping people
deny it.
"
213,1,"
Let me start by saying Interstellar was the most anticipated movie of
my life. I loved all of Nolan's previous films and I love the sci-fi
genre too so this seemed like my dream come true. It turned out to be a
sickening space nightmare.Inception and the prestige both strayed over the edge from thriller /
drama to sci-fi but this movie went a step further and started as
sci-fi but annoyingly moved into fantasy as it went along. The result
was a film which became immensely cheesy and just threw physics /
science out of the way to pursue its weak plot and inconsistent story.The characters were horribly conceived and totally unbelievable and the
robotic beings were the worst automatons I could ever envisage - they
literally did defy physics from the very beginning by walking and doing
many other things that a steel rectangle clearly would never be able to
achieve! Normally at the end of a good sci-fi I have a lot of questions and a
desire to read up on the film / plot but with interstellar the only
thing I want to know is who are all the people who gave this good
reviews and what is their mental state because I am afraid of meeting
them!
"
214,4,"
Why this film is on the top 250 I have no idea. It is without a doubt
Christopher Nolans worst film. Despite the visuals and sheer scale of this project I found it to be
very shallow and a lot of the time boring, and I'm a guy who enjoys the
work of Andrei Tarkovsky...Overall it was a sub par drama with elements of SCI FI already explored
by Nolans betters (Kubrick). If you want real SCI FI, try 2001 A Space Odyssey, Solaris, Original
Star Wars Trilogy. They're all better. If you want Nolan, try The
Prestige, Memento, Inception, all much better.

The 90 minutes I spent watching this were painful. My wife and I both
had enough and walked away. We didn't care to see the ending or what
became of the characters. The actors chosen didn't believably fit the
parts and the pace was glacial. The previews led me to expect an epic
space adventure, what I got was a bunch of talking heads with
cringe-worthy dialog. The scenes shot in space were worse than real
NASA footage from 10 years ago. Instead of rooting for the heroes, we
were hoping they would die off soon. Characters that were supposed to
be brilliant scientists came across as uneducated and lacking in
self-discipline. It appeared to be a combination of the writing and
acting. The story itself stretched credulity to the breaking point,
people behave differently that what was portrayed.

By no means I am a scientific geek, my days of tackling with science
has been fortuitously truncated years ago, so putting aside all these
heatedly discussed astrological concepts, to be specific, wormhole,
black hole, tesseract, the fifth dimension and time travel relativity
(thanks to the enormous contribution of Dr. Kip Thorne), INTERSTELLAR
is a potent analogue of Nolan's previous stunning visual and conceptual
extravaganza INCEPTION (2010, 9/10), which looks deep into the bizarre
inner activity within one's dream realm, but this time, Nolan's scope
is going the opposite direction, extended outwardly to the unknown
universe and based on a more perceivable future of the earth's imminent
doom (we are all the culprits of various degrees in this scenario), it
is not just an awe-inspiring outer-space odyssey, in its dual
storyline, the life on earth is phenomenally linked by human's
primitive force - love. I didn't watch the film on an IMAX screen, which in Cairo is quite
scarce, and Cairo is a big city, but I have no gripe to watch it on a
normal 2D screen since it is fantastically overwhelming just the same.
In the pre-space trip , ex-pilot-turned-farmer Cooper (McConaughey) is
staying with his two children, Murph, short for Murphy (Foy) and Tom
(Chalamet) with his father-in-law Donald (Lithgow), while their world
is experiencing extreme weather catastrophe such as sand storms, the
father-and-daughter bond between Cooper and Murph has been intensified
through their similar attitude towards science and the supernatural
episodes happened in Murph's room, where she claims there is a
""phantom"" using gravity to send her messages, which is such an
ingenuous yet inconspicuous maneuver to foreshadows the mind-blowing
twist in the black hole, and unthinkably it becomes the key to save all
the humanity on earth. The emotional crunches are prepped with incredible performance, again,
McConaughey is unbelievably trans-formative as the loving father who
decide to reunite with Murph and keep his promises against all odds,
his supreme reaction shots when reading messages for the past 23 years
from Tom and Murph on earth are his Oscar-baiting moments, it seems the
McConaussance has not been slowing down and one Oscar statue seems not
enough at all. Mackenzie Foy plays the young Murph, Chastain is her adult version and
Burstyn gives the final happy ending as the senior one. Chastain is a
relentless fireball, formidably interprets the most arcane part (the
telepathic revelation of who is the phantom?) which sometimes even
challenges its own credibility, it is not a showy role for Chastain's
caliber, nevertheless she is excellent in it, take one example, the
minute facial nuances when Prof. Brand (Michael Caine) telling her the
disturbing truth in his deathbed are handled with almost undetectable
forbearance yet viewers can maximally sense the repercussions since it
shakes all her belief in one second. Foy is equally brilliant as the
young Murph, she sets a solidified base with Cooper, which sustains the
mainstay of the film's critical emotional core and guides us through
the transcendent experiences with Cooper, and a new child star is
officially born. Hathaway's Brand, although second billed, surprisingly doesn't have too
much to offer as the co-pilot, sometimes even becomes a corny nuisance
(poor Wes Bentley!), there is another type of father-daughter
undercurrent (she and Caine) which the film largely dodges. During Cooper's expedition to find suitable planet for earthlings,
there is the punned ""Murphy's Law"" effect subsequently occurs, Matt
Damon's classified cameo is well-kept from the trailer and his
appearance further cements his recent string of involvement with Sci-Fi
genre (after THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU 2011, 6/10, ELYSIUM, 2013, 7/10 and
Terry Gilliam's THE ZERO THEOREM 2013, next year he will be in Ridley
Scott's THE MARTIAN with Chastain), his Dr. Mann is the revered pioneer
in the project, however it is through him, Nolan builds the only real
villain (arguably Caine the big fat liar is condemnable as well), who
succumbs to human frailties under the extreme condition, his motive is
understandable, any of us could make the same move under his condition,
that's why the film is so precious, one has to overcome all the innate
barriers to achieve something extraordinary, say without this
commitment with Murph, without the uninhibited love for her daughter
(poor Tom, his father never even mention him at all), maybe Plan B is
the future for human race, and the cruelty is freshly in our face. After GRAVITY (2013, 9/10), we reach a new monumental peak for the
cosmic cinematography, pairing with a new DP Hoyte Van Hoytema (from
HER 2013, 8/10; TINKER TAILER SOLIDER SPY 2011, 6/10, THE FIGHTER 2010,
8/10 and LET THE RIGHT ONE IN 2008, 9/10), Nolan's galactic wonders are
sufficiently groundbreaking, the three planets they visit bear
simplistic topography grafted with inconceivable excesses, and the
final homeland, the distorted proportion, all evokes the striking
variations in INCEPTION. And if Alfonso Cuarón can win BEST DIRECTOR
for GRAVITY, Nolan is much more deserving, I am firmly standing behind
Nolan's back this, it is a cinema-goer's ultimate luck to have
filmmakers like Nolan dares to make these ""impossible and grand
venture"" to enlighten our imagination and edify our own consciousness
as a human being in this imperfect world, with the prowess of love we
all possess, however small we are individually, there is hope always
beckoning, eternally.

A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously
take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or
you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX
screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what
Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience
(there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it.
It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading
(no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful
... and terrifying at the same time.Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be
too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The
deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an
indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good,
but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But
the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way
this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ...

The film is one of the films that gave me ideas on how much powerful it
is to tell as well researched story filled with love. For the Director,
I have learn so much, from watching his film collection, how He use the
word Powerful, from Inception said by Leo and in Interstellar said by
Anne. The search to me is like finding who really you are in life, and
when you do, always remember you can only stop time from moving when
you do what you know love the most. To me Interstellar is like is a
movie of all time that help you find yourself. I am proud of Mr. Nolan,
and since I am In Tribeca and He is here I will be happy to meet him
and learn more from his art.I watched it twice in one day, all I can say is it's a move that needs
you to watch over and over and over, to understand the art of telling a
story. I rate 10/10My question for Mr Nolan is will finding the new life on the other
planet stop people from harming nature?

Interstellar _ My Experience Love is the only thing that transcends
Time and SpaceI am not sure whether I am intelligent enough to review this film, but
as a normal viewer, I am going to share my views about the Interstellar
Experience.My Interstellar experience started even before watching the film
itself, I spent some time, brushing up my knowledge about the theories
discussed in the film. The advantage of being a Physics student made my
work easy. In fact, the movie became much more understandable. In the near future, our earth becomes more polluted and human beings
have to find a new home to survive or at least to stop their species
from extinction. NASA sends a group of explorers into a newly
discovered wormhole to find a habitable land for the humans. This is
just the basic plot of a wonderful experience.This is a Christopher Nolan film and he wants the viewer to have some
basic knowledge of physics to understand the film. He is best known for
the novelty in themes and the emotional approach he takes. The Dark
Knight Trilogy director maintains his trademark of elevating the
content than the characters. Nolan literally takes us to the outer
space, from earth to various planets through the wormhole. One would
really feel oneself as Cooper while watching the film. Placing some
unexpected events in between, the writer amazes the viewer. Especially,
the climax. The final phases of Interstellar were mind-blowing and
thought provoking. I was blown away by the ideals Nolan placed in the
penultimate scenes. The concept of fifth dimensional sequences inside
the tesseract came out as a surprise, those sequences were beyond my
imagination. One of the best climaxes ever. While watching the climax,
only one thought appeared in my mind, ""How can this Nolan be so
brilliant and imaginative!""Special Kudos to the Nolan brothers for those excellent and heart
touching dialogues. Even in the simpler scenes, certain dialogues came
out as wonder.Nolan wanted to express something which any space exploration film
didn't express: the eternity of love. The emotional approach Nolan
takes to describe the father-daughter relationship between Cooper and
Murph was heart touching. He even draws a sketch over the life of space
explorers. How they spend years of their life, selflessly, searching
for something that will be beneficial for the people on the earth,
keeping their lives at risk. The unnoticed friendship between Cooper &
TARS and the light humor they produce, proves Nolan's mastery in
presenting complex subjects in a simpler way.Christopher Nolan's films which are known for their utmost brilliancy
in making also have memorable characters and Interstellar is no
exception. Oscar winning Matthew McConaughey, perfected as Cooper.
Cooper will always remain as one of the most remarkable characters of
all time. He excelled in the emotional scenes. I felt like crying, when
Cooper watches the recorded videos sent to him from the earth, such
perfection. Anne Hathaway and Miachel Caine too delivered memorable
performances as Amelia Brand and Professor Brand. Anne was good in the
emotional scenes, especially in the scene, she reveals her love for
Edmund. Miachel Caine had an important role this time, a lengthy one
indeed. The kid Murph came out as a surprise, Mackenzie Foy had all the
emotions required for the character. Jessica Chastain too delivered
good performance as the adult Murph. Casey Affleck 's negative shaded
Tom and Matt Damon's extended cameo appearance as Dr.Mann were also
interesting. The two robotic characters, TARS and CASE too had equal
importance in the story line. TARS will surely be remembered as one of
the best robotic characters of all time.Music by Hans Zimmer and camera works by Hoyte van Hoytema makes
Nolan's simple approach to the complex theme successful. Zimmer offered
scores matching the mood of the film, in fact, certain scenes were too
silent to be enjoyed, could have made better. Cinematography by Hoytema
was a work of wonder. Nolan didn't use any great graphics or anything.
He used limited amount of Visual Effects, concentrating more on the
subject. So, this film will be a better experience for the ones who
believe that content of the film is more important than Visual Effects. Interstellar is more of an experience than a film. Missing this film on
Big Screen will end in deep regression. Special Note to the ones who are going for this film: In this film
explorers are seen rotating their space ship, usual audience may not be
able to understand the theory behind it i.e., the creation of
artificial gravity. There are many such moments in the film, which are
related to deeper physics. So before watching the film, just go through
the topics such as, artificial gravity, wormholes, neutron star,
relativity, time dilation and tesseract. An idea about these topic make
the Interstellar experience an easier one.I will be able to understand the film ""completely"" only after watching
it again. I am fully satisfied with this Experience. I will be a able
to rate this film only after watching it again.""In this universe, there is time, there is space, there is gravity and
there is 'love among human beings', which is much more powerful than
all other universal parameters.""I Thank Christopher Nolan for this Interstellar Experience.Thank You for reading my views about Interstellar. Yours Truly. Sooraj

The theater sound was somehow screwed up for this movie. The dialog was
very difficult to hear and the ""background"" music was way too loud. In
spite of that just enough dialog got through to follow the story, but
the sound problems weren't the real problem.I guess if you're a serious SiFi fan you might like this movie. I am
not a big SiFi fan (other than the plausible Star Trek sort). I didn't
enjoy this movie.There was no real foundation for why the earth was failing; you're
supposed to guess. There was no background to suggest power sources for
space vehicles that would last so long. There was no explanation for
how the sleep modules worked. In fact there was no foundation or
explanation for pretty much anything in the movie. You were just
supposed to believe.There is no preparation for the flight. Cooper is an experienced pilot
but the crew doesn't seem to know each other so they spent no time
together before the multi-year flight. You're just supposed to accept
all of that and look past it.Near the end Cooper ejects himself from his space craft out into space
in his space suit. He's in a distant galaxy accessible through a worm
hole but the last we knew he seems to have gotten trapped in a black
hole. There is nothing but hocus pocus that has him land in a hospital
on a space station at the end of the movie; no rescue attempt, nothing.
You're just supposed to believe. I don't mind wild scenarios but they have to be plausible at least.
Maybe even 50% plausible?I truly had a difficult time sitting through the movie and was glad
when it was over. I wish I had stayed home and watched reruns of The
Big Bang Theory. The movie was a waste of time and money.

I guess the key to truly enjoy Interstellar is to think of it not as a
sci fi movie but as a fantasy movie set in space. The cinematography is truly stunning, flawless. It breaks from some of
the conventional shots and ideas you would expect on the space scenes
and it does that with superb results. But it seems that the plot is not
at the same level.Don't get fooled by the talk about wormholes and relativity, the
science behind it is closer to a Doctor Who script than to 2001. Not
that I have anything against Doctor Who, I love it, but they don't try
to pass it as hard sci-fi. And sometimes it goes from bad science to
downright impossible and cheesy, with some pages stolen from Space
Cowboys or Armaggedon.And that is a shame, because this could have been one of the best
movies ever, and the spiritual successor to 2001, but it does not have
the courage to do so, opting for a more commercial and accessible
script, with some memorable moments mixed with some dialogues I want to
forget.It is a great movie and you should definitely see it, just avoid
falling for those 10/10 reviews.

quick and simple review. i gave it 2 out of 10. it started out great i was sucked in. but then for some reason the
writers seemed to mix it up with a twist at the end that wasn't needed.
and completely trashed the film. on another note it was hard to get
past the fact that i feel it was matt damons worst performance i have
seen. and i am a matt damon fan.so in a summary. the first half of the movies was great, but its hard
to hold onto that first half when i came to vote due to how bad the 2nd
half got.on a personal note. if mat damon reads his bad reviews like some do.
then sorry but as a fan of yours. i have to say. you was in my top 3
actors that you could always count on being a great movie when you see
they are in it. but intersellar,Elysium i found to be bad movies. plus
The Monuments Men i stopped watching half way in when i realized its
just boring and not getting any better.

""Go colonize Mars instead"".What was the point of the mission? To save humanity.How? By evacuating all of Earth on huge space stations to another
planet, accessible through a black hole near Saturn... And you need to
gather data about the singularity to finish the antigravity equation to
do it.1 direct trip from Earth to Saturn = 8 ROUND trips from Earth to Mars.So... ""Go colonize Mars instead"".Also, the robot design was very impractical.P.S. Who colonizes/lands on a planet with a ""1 hour = 7 years outside""
time anomaly?! Pointless suicide!.

OK, first off, this is a truly dull story. What has clearly happened is
that a roomful of executives have set out to make a 'Great Sci-fi
Movie' and failed dismally.Why? Well, it probably went like this: Exec 1: What other great sci fi films have there been? Exec 2: Silent Running? Exec 1: Oh yeah, great. Let's use the friendly robot helpers they had
in that.Exec 3: What about the earth running out of resources? Exec 1: You mean like in Soylent Green? OK, put that in..Exec 4: Time travel is always good - Can we have a sequence where it
goes all ethereal and a character experiences another dimension? Exec 1: What. Like in 2001? OK. We also need some kind of strong female
character..Exec 2: Can she be like Sigourney Weaver in Alien? Exec 1: OK. Right, what about Star Trek? I think a few phrases from
that would come in handy..Exec 3: Wormhole? Singularity? Exec 1: Yep, and throw in a few good old American things too..Exec 2: Baseball? Twice enough? Exec 3: And what about an untrustworthy villain - like Doctor Smith in
Lost in Space? Exec 1: OK! All we need now is to make it fashionable enough to suck in
the crowds.Exec 4: Well we're going to need a long running time. All the best
films seem to be over 2 hours now.Exec 1: Make ours over 3 then. And get that bloke who did Inception to
direct. Everyone thought that was very clever.In short, Interstellar has stolen little bits from all the classic
space and sci-fi films and stitched them together to form something
that is very much less than the sum of it's parts. Emotional scenes
have been ladled on thicker than a sea of treacle too - Two parent
dying scenes, endless relationships with children issues, the pain of
being away from home...I really cannot see why so many people have chosen to rate this film so
highly. The Emporer's New Clothes perhaps?

My wife and myself are big Sci-Fi fans and were anxiously anticipating
the release of this movie.After a disappointing first half-hour, we obviously hung in there and
stayed in order to give the movie a chance thinking it would pick up
around Lift Off and the subsequent Outer Space journey.Unfortunately, we nearly headed for the nearest exit around the mid
point of the movie. Instead, we demanded a refund and the Theatre
Manager gave us passes for another movie.We both found the acting and dialog flat and somewhat cliché and found
the AI machine to be the most intriguing of the characters. I am
shocked to see a fine cast fall flat due to the material given to work
with. Nolan should have let the Actors Ad Lib.We were quite comfortable with missing the ending, which one member
stated it was ""disappointing"" as well.The editing was horrible. How this movie did not have more scenes cut
is mind boggling. As one reviewer mentioned: What was the purpose of
the scene with the drone.The entire first hour, which told the story of the earth's problems
creating the need to find a new home could have been condensed to just
a few minutes. I realize it is important to develop the characters, but
in this case there was only one member of the family going on the Outer
Space Mission.We also found some of the special effects laughable since the Space
Craft and Saturn looked like the miniature models that they obviously
are.I am rating this movie 4 out of 10 and I sincerely feel that this is
overly generous.Hopefully, Nolans' next movie will have better qualities since this
motion picture was a disaster.

Interstellar was an absolutely breathtaking experience for me. I
thought the writing, the direction, the score and especially the acting
(Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy both gave equally phenomenal
performances) were all top notch. The film had the feeling of space
films from the past, like 2001: A Space Odyssey (as many have said
before), but I thought it also had elements of other space adventures,
namely Apollo 13 and Planet of the Apes (the original 1968 film).Another thing that truly resonated with me was Hans Zimmer's gorgeous
film score, that I swear he took (musical) notes on what made John
Williams film music so moving, and he gave an equally immersive
soundtrack to the film that adds another emotional dimension to
Christopher Nolan's latest blockbuster epic. Never was the music out of
place; it always fit in perfectly with what was going on. It can be its
own thing from the film, and it truly tells its own story through
sound, something that not many movies have accomplished in quite
sometime.The space scenes in particular, have music played to that shows it very
much is, and feels like this great expanse of the unknown, an infinite
vacuum of an ocean that is full of many beauties and terrors. Hans
Zimmer basically added to the already sweeping story of space and time,
with an equally overwhelming score that I did not expect to be impacted
by it in such a way.Christopher Nolan takes the audience to where they've never truly gone
to before until now, through wormholes and the time distortion that
black holes can make to nearby planets. It is a big yet beautifully
done self-contained adventure. It is not only a fully fledged space
epic, but also a cautionary environmental warning for what will happen
if we don't leave the Earth when it is a desolate, dust-coated
wasteland.I don't know for sure if Interstellar will get the Oscar glory like
some were predicting before, but either way, I'm happy that I saw such
an ambitious film that has left an impact on quite a lot of people
already. It would be nice if it got a Best Picture, Best Actor or Best
Screenplay nomination but I don't know for sure; however its music,
cinematography and special effects will surely get rightful Academy
Awards recognition in 2015.If you want a true space opera that encompasses the wonders of the
galaxy, time travel and completely believable characters that need to
save humanity, Interstellar is the film for you.Thank you Christopher Nolan. You are such a wonderfully talented
filmmaker. Interstellar was such a wonderful gift.P.S. See the film in IMAX 70mm whenever you can, or at the usual
cineplex; just see it when you can, folks!

Yup Nolan did it again and this time he has taken his movie to another
dimension.!!'Interstellar' is the story of a man trying to save his family and then
saving humanity from extinction. Its full of space adventure and
breath-taking actions on some of the most beautiful and unrealistic
locations around the UNIVERSE. To realize Nolan's master-piece it Is better if polish our ideas about
space-time theory. We know space is defined in 3 dimensions and
Einstein in his theory of relativity uses Time as the 4th dimension.
But Scientists in the movie realize that Gravity has the tendency to
flow across all these 4 dimensions and thus Gravity is designated to be
the Fifth Dimension. It is believed that whoever holds to understand
and master the knowledge of this 5 dimensions will be able to move
anywhere in Time and Space. In this movie a certain species referred as
""THEY"" has the knowledge of this five dimensions and it is THEM who
wants Humans to save themselves.In the film various Scientific and Astronomical theories are used, and
it will help if viewers have a brief idea about them too.Murphy's law- It is an adage or epigram that is typically stated as:
Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. A statement relating
possibilities with Certainty.Worm hole- It is a bridge, a hypothetical topological feature of
space-time that would fundamentally be a shortcut through space-time. A
wormhole is much like a tunnel with two ends, each in separate points
in space-time. Though undiscovered, Some believe that wormhole could be
used to travel through galaxies.Black hole- It is a region of space-time from which gravity prevents
anything, including light, from escaping. The boundary of the region
from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Inside
the hole what happens is still a mystery, and that's where Nolan's
creativity brings about.The movie is filled with unproved theories and unrealistic scenarios.
But the way Nolan has directed it, you wont want to blink you eyes even
for a moment. The graphics are, no doubt, marvelous. The cast did a
stupendous job and . Though laws has been broken to keep the ending
sweet, it is well deserved as LOVE has no rules and no dimensions.Conclusion: Watch it again and again.. and it gets better and better.!

Every generation of movie goers sees one film, maybe two, that changes
the game for them. It becomes a signature moment that they remember
years to come. They remember where they saw it, who they saw it with,
even where they were sitting. Christopher Nolan has proved to be a film
maker who works best with a big canvas, and he has never been given a
canvas bigger than the one he used for his latest film, ""Interstellar"".
I feel I can't even call going to see a Nolan piece a movie but more
like an ""event"". For the average movie goer, they most likely aren't
familiar with the directors of the films they're seeing but most know
Nolan. Most know of Nolan because he has made some of the biggest,
thrilling, and thought provoking films of the past decade from the Dark
Knight trilogy to Inception.It's almost not worth trying to do a plot synopsis of ""Interstellar""
because it is difficult to try to condense the happenings in a film
this huge because I know that I will leave out something big. Anyway,
the film takes place in a potentially not-too-distant future where the
earth has become unable to produce all but a few crops and it will get
to a point where none will be able to grow and man will die out. In
comes an engineer/pilot/father Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who is
entrusted to be part of a space expedition to venture beyond a newly
discovered wormhole to try and find a new planet capable of inhabiting
the human race. Astronauts from previous missions have supposedly
landed and have been sending signals for them to come.McConaughey has always had that ""movie star"" potential and I think this
is the film that puts him in that title. This was a truly star making
role due to the size of the film and I honestly believe he is the only
man who could have done it. ""Interstellar"" was originally supposed to
be done by Steven Spielberg before he dropped out and Nolan stepped in.
Nolan, clearly influenced by past Spielberg films like ""Close
Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""Jaws"", puts McConaughey in a role in
the same vein as Richard Dreyfuss in ""Close Encounters"" or Roy
Schneider in ""Jaws"". They needed an actor who could be looked at as an
everyday guy who is experiencing incredible circumstances and
McConaughey is able to display the emotion required for a man who has
to drop everything, including his family whom he knows he may not see
again, and try to save the human race. You can see it in his eyes and
hear it in his voice and your heart breaks and lifts with his
simultaneously. This isn't necessarily a role that wins Oscars but it
should be.The effects are obviously amazing. This, much like ""Gravity"" last year,
is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen, especially in IMAX.
This, along with the haunting score of frequent Nolan collaborator Hans
Zimmer, almost transports you to that necessary place that makes the
events happening on screen seem possible. Kind of piggy backing off of
that point, there will be those who will trash the film for ""the
science isn't accurate"". Those comments are nonsense because no matter
what ""science"" tells us, there is just no way for us to actually
comprehend what is beyond a wormhole or what would happen if we
attempted to go through one. Could we really transcend time and space?
Would we discover new worlds and new civilizations? Impossible for us
to say at this point, but what makes this film so great is that we are
able to see the ideas of ""what can be"". It's the mystery of the unknown
that both frightens and enthralls man and few films have been able to
capture those feelings like ""Interstellar"" In a time where there are no
more explorers, we're fortunate to be put in a position where we can
feel what is like to discover and explore new worlds.People will remember ""Interstellar"" for either being a truly great film
experience or ""not as good as 2001: A Space Odyssey"". This is one of
most popular slights against the film so far as it is the closest thing
to ""2001"" and defenders of the Kubrick classic will argue to the death
that it doesn't live up to it. This is an argument that no one will win
because it is a generational issue. People see these landmark films
during their youth and they leave such an impression on them, that it
almost becomes blasphemy to hear of another film made years later,
rivaling the one they saw. People want to believe that the film from
their time was the best and that no film will be able to capture those
emotions they first felt and the memories that it created for them. I
respect and detest this because I will most likely feel the same way
when future space adventures in the same vein as ""Interstellar"" come
out and I fear it is something that is out of my control. Much of the
film circles around the idea that love is the one true thing that
travels purely through time and space because it is that connection we
feel with one another that makes us human and that can be applied with
our love for certain films. The connection we feel with our favorite
films is almost unshakable and those who think they can make us waver
from those feelings are exercising in futility.In the end, ""Interstellar"" is one of those landmark films. It's a
chance for us to escape reality and feel sense of adventure, hope, and
amazement that rarely comes around. Don't miss it.

""Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at
close of day."" that was one hell of a dialog from the movie
#INTERSTELLAR even though it was inspired from a poem. Chris Nolan made a film which make's even science freaks also don't
know some of 'em which he implied in the film. It is evidently clear
that he doesn't like this 3-D world which instead he created 5-D world
and made 'Time' as a physical quantity in his world. Literally there is
no words to explain the ingenuity of Chris. The way he crafted the
characters and effectively using technical expertise and screen writing
definitely make us to taste 'Transcendence'. once again he proved that
he is not a contemporary director but a director who evolved from
unrealistic future.Matt did a splendid job by portraying 'cooper' and express his emotions
as a destitute and grief-stricken father was incomparable. Hans zimmer,
he is at his best. Anne and Jess made justice to their roles. Matt
Damon and Michael Caine played a pivotal role as well. Chris also made
'India' as part of his film because of 'M.O.M' i think, even though it
is little about India i think. overall film is astoundingly superb with
intense screenplay unless you detest physics or you lack keenness but
its better to study a Lil'bit before 'bon appetite'. Remember ""do not
go gentle into that good movie"".#INTERSTELLAR and #INCEPTION are the best sci-fi masterpieces i've ever
seen in this decade. Take a bow Chris Nolan and ""orgoglioso DI es sere
UN fan DI Christopher Nolan''

Interstellar moves me to an infinite-dimensional with 120 minutes of
amazing EPIC, story and scenes. Our earth has been fulled with crowds
and dark future, i felt how much the human in need to discover a new
space livable dimensions. But i am not sure if that scientific theories
are able to process. Whatever, I will not hide that sense of
entertainment i felt while watching ""Interstellar"". Really it is More
than excellent movie.

First of all, i think every movie is almost impossible to be perfect in
all ways, it might be rare BUT This movie , how can i say it ,, WOW ..
Perfect !!Interstellar almost contains no errors or failures. The Story, the
script, sound effects and the cast was something spectacular, i
appreciate the good work from the full cast and especially from Nolan,
ans also from Hans Zimmer (composer and record producer) ! Highly
recommended.The story goes around a drama full of adventure and thrill about some
explorers who are engaged in a long journey to discover the space.

Another outer space film from Hollywood, this time directed by
INCEPTION's Christopher Nolan. Thankfully it's better than the
overrated GRAVITY, but INTERSTELLAR soon turns out to be overrated in
turn. It seems that as soon as a film comes out these days with a half
intelligent premise, critics and audiences lap it up and rate it as one
of the best ever. INTERSTELLAR is far from that. It has plenty of
interesting moments, but the overlong running time is padded and
bloated with endless sentimentalism and extraneous characters.It also takes a heck of a lot of time for anything to actually happen.
Matthew McConaughey is all earnestness as the protagonist and comes
across as a dullard; Anne Hathaway's character is completely extraneous
and lacking in charisma. Only old timers like John Lithgow and Michael
Caine shine, although Wes Bentley is underutilised in his role. An
unexpected appearance from Matt Damon is undoubtedly the story's
highlight.For much of the running time this follows the template of a typical
space adventure, but around the middle part of the film it starts to
get weighed down with endless CGI effects and the whole end part of the
production gets muddled and predictable in equal measure, coming across
like a rip off of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY but not nearly as good.

The movie I was searching for last 4 years.. I always questioned
teacher where do we implicate all the concept we study and Christopher
did that. Man! He is so great he always make something new which
hallucinates our mind great work dude. The movie which gives a
practical applications of Newton's law of gravitation, Einstein theory
of relativity the actual concept of space and time and the truth of
gravity. Though the concept of world after black seems to be quite
grumbling. Anyways no one can make such a movie ever. Sir Christopher
Nolan no one can ever compete you. Mind blowing. IMDb : 9. The reason
for that it interferes the concept of Allah and ""they"" and nothing much
I suggest everyone to watch this movie
"
235,9,"
I recommend this movie because of its amazing implication and moving
story. In the film, a crew of astronauts travel through a wormhole in
search of a new home for humanity. I learned about new knowledge of space this time. Also, it created my
interest about space and its mysterious wormhole. Further, acting was
really great. I feel love for the family even if I don't have any
child. This made me touched. If you see this movie, you can be moved and tensed. During the movie,
you can't relieve your tension. Or you can see yourself who is crying
when the movie ends.
"

Even I didn't know about the space and science, I could enjoy this
movie. Actors acting are very good and the computer graphics also
really fantastic and reality. But some scenes are difficult to
understand because there are too many science words. Otherwise that
makes me wonder why that happened. I thought and thought and thought. I
feel I would be a Space Research Institute. But actually not. I think
all the people thinking will different with me. My father say this is
so boring, maybe this movie is so long and even quite. Anyway I enjoyed
this movie very much and before I slept, I recall this movie story. If
you guys want to be a space research institute, you must watch this
video. it makes you more interested in your study

In ""Interstellar,"" expect to see giant wormholes that lead to distant
solar systems, unprecedented planets with familiar terrain and nature,
years on Earth translate to minutes in space, gargantuan black holes,
and a desperate mission to find a new planet to inhabit.""Interstellar"" was a fascinating movie that makes you think about the
universe and its future, written and directed by Christopher and
Jonathan Nolan, who also created the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy and
""Inception"". The visuals of outer space are amazing, high- definition,
and captivating. Michael McConaughey is the star of the movie as
Cooper, alongside Anne Hathaway as Brand, Jessica Chastain as Murph
Cooper, Casey Affleck as Tom Cooper, Michael Caine as Professor Brand,
Matt Damon as Mann, and Wes Bentley as Doyle. This movie will make you
break down in tears, smile with relief, sit on the edge of your seat in
exhilaration, and feel every emotion that you see on the screen.In ""Interstellar"", the human population faces its demise as the Earth
is plagued with drought, famine, and extreme climate changes. Cooper
(Michael McConaughey) had his own set of problems, tending to his crops
and helping his children get through school. However, he and his young
daughter, Murph, find the remote site of NASA, the once-glorified
American space program that was eventually forgotten about; all of
NASA's journeys to space were considered fake and unaccomplished.
Cooper was asked to be a part of mission to find another planet to save
the human race. Reluctant to leave his family, knowing that he may
never see them again due to relativity and time distortion in space,
Cooper embarks on this journey in order to save humanity. A group of
astronauts must travel space to search for another planet to inhabit to
prevent the extinction of the human race. These astronauts take
numerous risks in order to save time, since years on Earth pass by in
mere minutes and seconds in space, including traveling through
wormholes, around black holes, and to distant solar systems and
planets. Back on Earth, Murph and Tom grow up without their father,
Cooper, and Murph and Professor Brand try to help find a new place to
live.""Interstellar"" allows the audience to be in the spaceship with the
astronauts, fearing for their lives, their mission, their families, and
their futures with the other astronauts as Earth-years pass by in
minutes and seconds in space. Viewers will leave the theater wondering
if this science-fiction film can anticipate their future.
"
238,10,"
it is an excellent movie, full of amazing visuals, and emotions. if you
do not like science maybe this movie will be a little boring for you.
the physical theories are represented as good as they can, and if you
do not know the science behind, maybe you will not understand half of
the movie. It has a lot of great emotional moments and can make you cry
several times, but its strongest point is that it has a lot of science
involved, so , if you are an engineer or a physicist you will love this
movie forever. it's soundtrack is completely epic, like everything that
Mr. Zimmer does, and if you are a musician you will love it. And
please, if you hate science and you are just wanting to watch a movie
to pass time, please insert finding Nemo DVD instead of hating this
amazing movie. and please remember: it is a fiction movie, please do
not be a Neil Degrasse wannabe and miss judge this movie.

Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar,"" about astronauts traveling to the
other end of the galaxy to find a new home to replace humanity's
despoiled home-world, is frantically busy and earsplittingly loud. It
uses booming music to jack up the excitement level of scenes that might
not otherwise excite. It features characters shoveling exposition at
each other for almost three hours, and a few of those characters have
no character to speak of: they're mouthpieces for techno-babble and
philosophical debate. And for all of the director's activism on behalf
of shooting on film, the tactile beauty of the movie's 35mm and 65mm
textures isn't matched by a sense of composition. The camera rarely
tells the story in Nolan's movies. More often it illustrates the
screenplay, and there are points in this one where I felt as if I was
watching the most expensive NBC pilot ever made. Interstellar is an
impressive, at times astonishing movie that overwhelmed me to the point
where my usual objections to Nolan's work melted away. (they could
apply to any Nolan picture post ""Batman Begins""; he is who he is) so
that people know that he's still doing the things that Nolan always
does. Whether you find those things endearing or irritating will depend
on your affinity for Nolan's style.

Such a fantastic film that is different to anything else you will see
again.. brilliant. From the moment we meet the main character through
the end of the film we are mesmerised through every single shot. I
cannot fault this film in any way shape or form. It is not a film in my
eyes, rather it is a piece of art that takes you on a journey of many
emotions and will make you leave thinking wow. If you ever get the
chance to see this film in the cinema again then i would strongly
suggest that you go and see it there because it is an experience that
cannot be recreated through a television screen. I saw like at the
Royal Albert Hall with a live orchestra and it was an experience that I
will never forget

Wormholes, black holes, singularity, 5th dimension...they all are in
the film. Interstellar is a film about a group of scientists who must
travel through a wormhole to save mankind. Being a science geek I
really loved the film. The movie is simply beautiful, bold cosmic
adventure story. Interstellar is grand, immersive and long that lets
'time' slip right through our eyes. The visual effects are top notch,
the acting is great and there are emotions throughout the movie. Almost
all about space-time is scientific and it actually gives a glimpse of
future. The soundtrack is captivating: you can't deny it. One of the
aspects I didn't like was the length of the film (its about
2hrs50mins), it feels drawn out near the end. And, about everyone in
the movie talking about relativity, quantum physics, black-holes, event
horizon, etc I just couldn't help but think how someone who isn't
interested in those topics would feel.
"
242,9,"
Interstellar is a great film.First off, the visual effects are stunning. Nolan blends practical and
computer generated imagery so well it's hard tell the difference. He
certainly establishes he is a master of his craft. The scenes that take
place in space had some of the best cinematography I saw in 2014. The
placement made it show how small and insignificant Cooper and his ship
were in the vast abyss of space. The idea for this film is simply epic. Traveling galaxies away from
home, searching for hope. It is obviously an homage to 2001, but it
works well. Matthew McConaughey is such a great actor in this film,
along with Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon. The rest of the actors are
great as well. My complaints lie in Murph's logic. Why would she believe at the
beginning that Cooper was her ghost? There was no evidence whatsoever. Still, all in all, this film was great, I believe it could have been
better, but it was an amazing film. The score by Hans Zimmer was one of
his best in my opinions, the acting was great, the conception for this
film was phenomenal, and the visual effects and camera work were jaw
dropping. I would recommend this film to sci-fi fans, or just an average
movie-goer. 9/10
"

Nolan, the perfectionist of our era has yet again delivered an epic
movie in the backdrop of space exploration. He handles all the science
stuff in an accurate manner where he takes us to another galaxy which
is a dream for every space lover. There are some mind blowing visuals
while travelling through black hole and the portrayal of the three
other worlds. I particularly enjoyed the stunning view of Saturn. Music
of Hans zimmer is an extraordinary pillar of the film especially the NO
TIME FOR CAUTION is awesome. All the lead characters were excellent in
performance wise. This movie will be researched in years to come to
praise the work of Nolan. ""LOVE TARS LOVE"".

OMG!!! I loved this movie because the characters made you fell
desperate in everything they were trying to obtain.I think I experienced every emotion and wanted to see more in the end.
I will not put any spoilers in this review, because some people in a
small village is waiting for the DVD to come out.It was worth watching, they did a great job making you think about what
is important in life and how you could easily change your perception.
Some people are so misguided by material things... in the end all you
need are the ones you love.This movie is also cool to see with family members, I do not remember
feeling awkward at all.

Nice movie. Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film directed
by Christopher Nolan and starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway,
Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine. The film features a crew of
astronauts who travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for
humanity. Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay,
which has its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007.
Christopher Nolan produced the film with his wife Emma Thomas through
their production company Syncopy and with Lynda Obst through Lynda Obst
Productions. Caltech theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, whose work
inspired the film, was an executive producer and acted as scientific
consultant. Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures, and Legendary Pictures
co-financed the film.
"
246,8,"
Personally, I do like 2h-and-longer movies, but only if they can
attract my attention in full durance. This is very very good movie, but
I wouldn't say a masterpiece. Why? I expected more convincing turns and
twists. Example; When the crew finds out that they were fooled by
dr.Brand, it is hardly well explained what kind of purpose leis in
their expedition. Dr Brand says there is no hope to find the ˝salvation
planet˝ because his equation is insufficient, yet they still have to
continue their research, as dr. Mann says: they are the future, not the
Earth inhabitants. What's that mean? They will die searching? What's
the difference then between them and those left behind??Nolan is one of my favorites, but still something's missing here.
"
247,7,"
My wife, no sci-fi fan, expressed an interest in this almost-three-hour
""2001"" wannabe b/c the physicist who came up with the original story
idea, Kip Thorne, was a colleague of her dad's at CalTech. Good to know
that the (quantum) mechanics of the plot are in accordance with current
thinking, but the best scenes are the early ones, while we're still
trying to figure out what's going on in this dys-something world, where
an exhotshot pilot is growing corn with the help of a smart combine
and today's Internet craziness (the Apollo landing was faked!) is the
received wisdom of the future. Later on, the Nolans come up with some nice relativistic plot
twistsAnne Hathaway's dawdling for a few minutes on a high-gravity
planet sets their schedule back by twenty-two years, Earth timeand the
storyline is always intriguing, but not really all that involving, at
least till the final scenes. The basic problem, IMHO, is too much sci
and not enough fi; one of the main reasons that ""2001"" is still the
gold standard is that Clarke and Kubrick don't try to explain away the
mystery.The A-listers in the cast all do fine; Mackenzie Foy as the 10-yr-old
Murph is perfect, though I was sorry that Bill Irwin (TARS the robot)
was just doing a voice-over. Hans Zimmer's score may make you feel at
times like a rat that's built its nest in a huge pipe organ, but it's
also quite effective toward the end, when McConaughey's character
reconnects with his estranged daughter from the depths of a black hole. In short, ""2001"" it's not, but, despite a few scenes where time seems
to come to a standstill (the frozen Matt Damon planet, e.g.),
""Interstellar"" is still pretty entertaining and occasionally thought
provoking as well

Nolan once again, did it. This film is incredible. It brought me to
tears. I reflected in life after the movie and made me think through a
lot of the reality of our present times. Interstellar dealt with a lot
of concepts that I am not very familiar about but is extremely
interested to tackle. I may not have the concept of a black hole, or a
wormhole, 3 dimensional or 4 dimensional world but he made everything
understandable, tangible and so real. I watched this on IMAX and it
felt so real. This film brought me to a different world full of
experience, A journey through space. A reality that no one will ever
had known. A big round of applause to Matthew McConaughey' for the
great acting. The creation of characters were to balance out everything
in the movie. For example, Matt Damon, the robot's character is made to
inject little humor despite the very serious matters that happens in
the film. I will definitely watch this film and share this with my
sisters.
"
249,8,"
Similarly, Gravity may have seemed philosophically flimsier, but it
made more sense (and arguably pushed the visual effects envelope
further) than Interstellar. Nolan's regular composer Hans Zimmer has
the measure of the madness, cooking up an eerie score that swerves from
the creaky Goblin-Esquire horrors of mid-period Dario Argento to the
imposing hallelujahs of what sounds like a massive church organ.While the end result may not represent the pinnacle of Nolan's
extraordinary career, it nevertheless reaffirms him as cinema's leading
blockbuster auteur, a director who can stamp his singular vision on to
every frame of a gargantuan team effort in the manner of Spielberg,
Cameron and Kubrick. ""Whose subconscious are we in?"" asked Ellen Page
in Inception. The answer here, as always, is unmistakably Nolan's
"
250,8,"
In the not-too-distant future of Interstellar, Earth has been ravaged
by an environmental disaster known as the Blight  forcing humanity to
abandon technology and the dreams of discovery, in order to focus on
basic survival. To that end, former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew
McConaughey), a widowed father of two, is now a farmer tasked with
growing one of the planet's last remaining sustainable crops: corn. In
a time when humankind has been asked to put aside personal desire in
the interest of a greater good, Cooper has attempted to make peace with
farm life, providing for his teenage children, Tom (Timothée Chalamet)
and Murph (Mackenzie Foy), as well as his aging father-in-law (John
Lithgow). Yet, even as conditions become increasingly dire on Earth,
Cooper's thirst for scientific discovery remains.However, when Cooper is reunited with an old colleague, Professor Brand
(Michael Caine), he is offered a new chance to fulfill an old ambition.
Informed that the situation on Earth is much more serious than he
previously knew, Cooper is asked to leave his family behind (in an
increasingly dangerous world) and set out on an uncertain journey into
space  to find humankind a new planet.Director Christopher Nolan has built a career on cerebral storytelling
 starting with his feature debut, Following, in 1998. Since that time,
the filmmaker has delivered one thought-provoking drama after another
(Insomnia, Memento, The Prestige, and Inception)  while also setting a
new bar for comic book adaptations with a contemplative three-film
exploration of Batman (and his iconic villains). As a result, it should
come as no surprise that Nolan's Interstellar offers another brainy
(and visually arresting) movie-going experience  one that will, very
likely, appeal to his base (those who spent hours pouring over minute
details in the director's prior works); however, it may not deliver the
same casual appeal that made Inception and The Dark Knight cross-
demographic hits.Interstellar is an imaginative movie, but a heavy-handed mix of
personal sacrifice and theoretical physics doesn't leave much room for
subtle storytelling (or particularly memorable action). For a film that
is rooted in the love between a father and his daughter, Interstellar
offers surprisingly cold (and often stiff) drama  albeit drama that is
buoyed by high-minded science fiction scenarios and arresting visuals.
Nolan relies heavily on lengthy scenes of surface-level exposition,
where characters debate or outright explain complicated physics and
philosophical ideas, to educate the audience and ruminate on humanity
(both good and bad) in the face of death and destruction.Unlike Nolan's earlier works, the filmmaker's passion is most apparent
in his science (based on the theories of physicist Kip Thorne) - rather
than his characters. This isn't to say that Interstellar doesn't
provide worthwhile drama, but there's a stark contrast between the
lofty space-time theories and the often melodramatic characters that
populate the story.McConaughey ensures his lead character is likable as well as relatable,
and manages to keep exposition-heavy scenes engaging. Still, despite a
169 minute runtime, Interstellar never really develops its central
heroes beyond anything but static outlines  and Cooper is no
exception. Viewers will root for him, and come to understand what he
cherishes and believes about humanity, but any major revelations come
from what happens to him  not necessarily what he brings to the table
or how he evolves through his experiences.The same can be said with regard to the supporting cast. Everyone
involved provides a quality turn in their respective roles, but they're
shackled by straightforward arcs  limited exposition machines that add
to the film's thematic commentary and/or advance the plot, but aren't
particularly well-realized or as impactful as Nolan intends. To that
end, in a cast that includes Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Casey
Affleck, and Matt Damon, two of the most memorable characters are
actually non-humans - quadrilateral-shaped robots, TARS and CASE, that
aid the crew on their adventure (and inject much-needed humor into the
proceedings).Casual film-goers who were wowed by the director's recent filmography
may find that Interstellar isn't as accessible as Nolan's prior
blockbuster movies  and dedicates too much time unpacking dense
scientific theories. Nevertheless, while the movie might not deliver as
much action and humor as a typical Hollywood space adventure, the
filmmaker succeeds in once again producing a thought-provoking piece of
science fiction. For fans who genuinely enjoy cerebral films that
require some interpretation, Interstellar should offer a satisfying
next installment in Nolan's well-respected career.That said, for viewers who are simply looking to get lost in a
thrilling adventure with memorable characters (from the director of
Inception and The Dark Knight), Interstellar may not provide enough
traditional entertainment value to balance out its brainy scientific
theorizing. On many levels, it's a very good film, but Interstellar
could leave certain moviegoers underwhelmed  and feeling as though
they are three-dimensional beings grasping for straws in a
five-dimensional movie experience.

When Christopher Nolan directs, Matthew McConaughey stars and Hans
Zimmer composes I instantly know I could be in for a treat. Journey
into space with Cooper (McConaughey), the last astronaut left on an
Earth near the end of existence. He and a group of explorers travel to
a mysterious wormhole which could help them migrate to galaxies and
dimensions beyond our own in order to save what's left of humanity.I walked into the cinema with sky high expectations before watching
Interstellar, and it did not disappoint, the film is great. Although it
is not perfect, actors like Anne Hathaway and Matt Damon don't perform
at their highest potential, and it often seemed like Christopher Nolan
struggled to piece the film together. But with an interesting concept
and scientifically accurate theories it will still have your attention
and have your heart racing from beginning to end.At its core, Interstellar is a tale of love between father and
daughter. The relationship between Cooper and Murph (played by
Mackenzie Foy, the strange CGI child from Twilight) is truly heart-
warming. This is a completely different ball park for Nolan, and it's
fantastically executed. We feel and care for their bond and it brings
more depth and emotion to the story. However it does feel as if it is
the cement that keeps it all together and without it the whole thing
would topple over, giving the idea that the story isn't as complete as
it should be.Without a doubt the film is beautiful. The world created by Christopher
and Jonathan Nolan is visually stunning. From the authenticity of the
icy planet which is ""Stark but undeniably beautiful,"" to the near
perfect atmosphere created by composer Hans Zimmer's monumental
soundtrack, Interstellar has us in aw from beginning to end as we
astound in the elegance, refinement and grace of this world.Matthew McConaughey is the crown jewel of the film, his performance has
assured his place in today's acting royalty, and this is the
performance that certifies him as well and truly ""back."" It is
heart-breaking, and it feels like every time this film had me well and
truly engaged he was on the screen. Some of the best sequences show
nothing but his face when he slogs through this disastrous, melancholy
and devastating mission he is on, and I would never take his place. He
makes us feel his emotion. I thought about how it would affect me more
than once, and that in its own way is terrifying. Interstellar is certainly not Nolan's best directional work,
(Inception, with Leonardo DiCaprio being my personal favourite)
although it's splendid in so many ways. McConaughey's sensational
performance is required due to the mediocrity of supporting
performances by Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon and Casey
Affleck. But as expected the cinematography, visual effects and
complexity of the film is brilliant. This once again proves that
Christopher Nolan is one of the best in the business, with his
consistency and intelligence shining through yet again. Perhaps more
than ever.
"

Its CGI and optical effects were seamless and the story was
interesting, the setup of the film with his family was well done, and
all together it was directed very well. My only complaints are that it
has some issues with the script, it never gave time for the story to
breath and I thought that the last 15 minutes were absolutely
unnecessary and could of been done a lot better. But it was a really
enjoyable film to watch. My favourite aspect of the film was the
amazing production design, but that's not enough to praise this film
and give it a higher rating than it deserves. My only complaint is the
unnecessary scenes, but that's not enough to hate it and rate this
lower than it deserves. So its a tough decision but I'm giving
Interstellar a 8/10 for its interesting story, and the fact that it was
very entertaining.
"
253,8,"
Amazing sound, amazing photography, amazing cinematography... Be
prepared to miss a couple lines of dialog when the sound gets so loud
it's drowned out briefly 3-4 times during the film.A wonderful ride that I, as a Sci-Fi fan, greatly appreciated. The
science holds up well apart from a couple crucial details. The plot has
some unnecessary holes that let it down for me.Spoilers follow:Science goof: Planet orbiting black hole near the event horizon
experiences time dilation. ""OK"" signal still received from explorer who
landed on it. But if seconds on the planet are stretched to many hours
off-planet, the ""OK"" signal would be stretched too and they
theoretically shouldn't receive it. This whole misadventure makes the
characters look dumb for being fooled so easily.Brand (Hathaway) needs to make big speech about love when they are
making decision about which planet to go to next (which could mean life
or death) instead of simply acknowledging the conflict of interest and
sticking to her original reasoning, which sounded reasonable to me....and then Cooper, recruited at the last minute as a pilot, just goes
ahead and makes the life-or-death decision for them. And Brand lets
him. None of this makes sense and the whole ""love is the 5th dimension""
speech is just irritating pseudoscience. Shades of Luke Besson's 5th
element.Having trouble dealing with Matt Damon's homicidal character. Did he
really need to kill Cooper to keep the truth about the planet a secret?
Was he just bat-s*** insane? I guess so. I had trouble with these unseen other ""them"" 5-dimensional beings
messing with us too. I guess the whole ""tesseract"" sequence was a way
to tie the movie together nicely. Which is exactly why I don't like it,
even if it was visually stunning, and quite touching despite the overly
convenient neatness of it.I don't think Christopher Nolan is any good at plot, and I think he
will make better movies if he doesn't try so hard at that.Good characters make for a good movie, unfortunately for the most part
the characters in this movie are quite flat and there is little
development. The two main female protagonists make unexplained
unlikeable decisions, and the male counterparts are not much better.Still worth seeing for the amazing set pieces, the visuals are at times
mind-blowing, and the science is sound enough to tickle the mind of
anyone with even the smallest knowledge of relativity theory, quantum
and string theory.
"
254,7,"
First of I am a big fan of Nolan's past films. Momento, The Prestige,
Batmen series. Those movies are just simply awesome. I think his weakness in directing (I won't say it's a flaw, though) was
started to show since Inception, and even more obvious in Interstellar:
He is not very good at manipulating the human feeling, or, he just
simply more enjoys elaborating the stories. He doesn't handle very well
about the connections and bonds between men and women, parent and
children, friends. However, his plots are usually so big and complex
and he loves playing with alternated cut scene (which I love). People
were too busy figuring out the story but ignoring the fact that human
connection is very weak.This movies almost give me the same feeling as Inception: A complex,
beautiful, kick-ass story with lots of open questions for the audience
to think. His signature scene-alternation is still cool and smooth.
Hans Zimmer's music is as good as usual. But other than that, it
actually quite empty. Too be honest, I almost feel like attending a
research seminar. The content was very interesting, the presenter told
a very cool story, but did I feel happy, sad, angry for the contents in
the seminar? No. Did I love the seminar? No. It's enjoyable, but I
won't go the same seminar second time. My emotion does not go up and down as the movie goes and I don't think
the slow-moving story helps either. I think fall to connect to the
audience is the biggest issue in this movie. Nevertheless, it still
well worth my 7 bucks just because of the super cool sci-fi storyline.

Imagine Gravity and 2001 - A Space Odyssey had a baby; they'd name it

recognisably normal version of the Earth's future. We're just a few
years ahead of our now and terrible climatic change is wreaking havoc
with our ability to produce enough food. America is pedalling
backwards, people are returning to the land in a desperate attempt to
grow enough food but it is clear we are in the end of days of the human
race. Cooper (McConaughey's character) is a widower, raising a teenage
son and daughter. The daughter, Murphy, is intellectually gifted and in
the early part of the narrative experiences poltergeist-type activity
in her bedroom; things gets broken, books get pushed off shelves,
strange lines appear on the floor when dust from a storm swills into
her room. These lines turn out to be a simple binary code, co-ordinates
of a secret NASA facility which Cooper sets off one night to
investigate. Enter Michael Caine and NASA's skeleton crew, the once
great and good space agency reduced to skulking in a mountain-side
because public opinion, with the Earth going to hell in a hand-cart,
not supportive of grand spending on the so-called folly of space
exploration.Michael Caine's character, a gifted physicist called Professor Brand
who Cooper knows from when he worked for NASA, has a grand vision for
the future of humanity. He also has some of the best lines, several of
which turn up in the trailers. You'll know the one I mean; ""Mankind was
born on Earth, we were never meant to die here."" Having discovered this
mission to save the Earth Cooper learns of a stable worm-hole that has
appeared in the orbit of Saturn which offers humans the opportunity to
travel in interstellar space to search out a new home. His mission with
a team of other astronauts, one of which is Professor Brand's daughter
(played by Anne Hathaway), is to travel through the worm-hole to
connect up with several pioneer missions that have already journeyed
interstellar. NASA has lost contact with them though.Enough plot to get you started I think, anymore begins to damage the
sheer joy and wonder of a beautifully constructed story. Interstellar
is science-fiction rooted deeply in science fact, it represents
Einstein's relativity in narrative form, showing fascinatingly the
time-bending qualities of dense gravitational fields. We have a black
hole, a singularity and theories of everything. Interstellar bends
narrative, back upon itself - lose not sight of that poltergeist - as
well as space-time (as relativity predicts) along with our minds. Great
story, great performances and cinema as it should be. Space is
experienced as deadly, beautiful and silent. The forces that shape our
Universe are portrayed superbly and the ridiculously puny nature of our
lives is writ large.Interstellar is definitely the best rendition of theoretical physics on
the big screen, a physicist, Kip Thorne was on board as a consultant
and producer. It's been generally well-received by critics and
justifiably so. It would be my film of the year so far. Story, script
and science beautifully intermingled and not an alien in sight. The one
sour note in the reviews was Peter Bradshaw's in the Guardian. I love
the Guardian but it does have on the payroll a cast of
intellectual-snobs whose main role in life seems to be to sneer and
whine. Bradshaw's reviews fails utterly in two respects, one it contains too
many spoilers not to destroy the experience of the story (so don't read
it here if you haven't seen the film yet) and secondly it fails utterly
to get the great big gravitational twist at the end (perhaps Mr
Bradshaw isn't quite as intellectual a snob as he thinks he is, which
might just leave him being a snob!) Three stars Mr Bradshaw does enable
you to deliver your normal sneery review but doesn't reflect at all the
popularisation of relativity and the beauty of space and science
Interstellar makes real on the big screen. Mark Kermode in the Guardian
also whines a bit, hey perhaps it's in the contract for journalists
joining the paper, talking about plot-holes. The only holes I could
spot were worm and black ones, along, of course, with the big one we
are digging ourselves as we destroy our ecosystem's ability to support
us.Interstellar is epic cinema as its best and it will inspire many
people, young and old, to journey deep and long and wide into the
wonders of science fact and fiction.**** (Four Stars)

Christopher Nolan is one of the most respected directors in the world
today. He has directed two of my favorite movies of all
time(Inception,The Dark Knight) and draws a crowd every time a movie
has his name on it. Interstellar is a good movie. Is it great? No. Is
it one of Nolan's best? Not even close. But this movie takes so many
risks, and most of them pay off and are incredible. This movie is
visually stunning, has great performances, and tells an entertaining
story. But there are a lot of conveniences, and the story outreaches
it's intellectual grasp. Overall, Interstellar is a great theater
experience and should be viewed by everyone. But don't go in expecting
everything to be perfect and mind-bending. It's just a good movie.
"

Interstellar is gorgeous to look at, and with lip-reading skills and
hearing protection, fun to see. However, the soundtrack is so utterly
overwhelming (drowning out dialogue in MANY instances; many people
around me were covering their ears. Just too much. Just too precious.
Very strange, as apparently Nolan went to various theaters (The Chinese
in particular) to screen it to adjust the sound before the opening. He
must be deaf.The pacing of this film is off too - with some scenes being
interminable and other, seemingly important parts being totally glossed
over. The build up is massively let down. When I realized where he was
- if I'd not already sat through 2.5 hours of this - I'd have walked
out. It was like Nolan just threw his hands up and commanded ""Ok tie
all this together!"" Very disappointing.It is being touted as an updated, improved 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Nothing could be further from the truth (though there are many moments
(sonically and visually) that are fairly obvious Kubrick homages). No -
this is an updated, VASTLY improved version of ""Frequency."" Let's see
if anyone is talking about Nolan (or Interstellar) in 35 years.Mackenzie Foy is brilliant as Murphy, and is easily one of the best
""child"" performances I've ever seen. McConaughey delivers too. In fact,
all of the acting is extremely good and very convincing.The special effects are stellar. Visually - I often was amazed to
remind myself that I was looking at CGI. It IS well worth seeing in a
theater on a big screen. I might wait a week or two to see if they can
get the sound balance fixed. (I saw it at the Cinderamdome in Los
Angeles, 70mm Film. In fairness, the sound issues illuminated that the
'dome has an AMAZING audio system - zero distortion, and easily as loud
as MANY concerts I've attended).A very good movie unfortunately let down by poor sound editing and
pacing errors. Generally - a movie with problems as large as this
wouldn't rate above a five - and that's even more disappointing - it's
just a few (albeit large) issues away from a nine.Obviously - there'll be a sequel.
"
258,7,"
Though the writing can be criticized, overall it's very watchable. Very
notable performance is given by Mackenzie Foy as young Murph.
Amusingly, she somehow looks very alike Anne Hathaway who plays Brand.You can pardon it taking liberties with physics. There is no enough
fuel on Earth to deliver a spacecraft back from the zone with >0.99c
escape velocity (and not enough fuel to slow it down for landing there,
in the first place). The enormous time dilation coefficient dictates
the escape velocity. But if it gets the plot moving, then OK.I watched it in IMAX 70 mm film projection. IT SUCKED. There was a lot
of shutter flicker on bright areas. These days, we don't see the
flicker caused the projector shutter (obturator), because modern
digital projectors mostly don't need them (though some older digital
projectors with sequential colors may have some, but it would be mostly
concealed). The image effective sharpness was never better than HD. The
editing workflow seems to have been digital, because there was unsharp
masking (digital sharpening) fringe always visible. There was AWFUL lot
of grain in the picture.Why do they still shoot film these days? Have they ever seen film and
digital side by side? It's like 78rpm gramophone disc sounds compared
to a CD. Does film grain, tinted colors, lousy sharpness make those old
school cinematographers hard? If the movie were shot completely on
modern digital cameras, it would have looked MUCH MUCH better.Famous IMAX audio was too loud. The low frequency rumble was so big
that it overdrives the ears and causes intermodulation, so that music
and speech is heard with tremolo.

I actually was expected a great work from Nolan, but he went more far
than we think, I don't know how to describe this movie, it's simply a
masterpiece!From the amazing performances of the actors to the marvelous music by
Zimmer, it's just a deep journey, I was just crying at the end, It
makes you feel, wonder, think and observe deeply in life, who we are?
what's happening?. Definitely need an Oscar (Best Picture - OST and
more)It's highly recommended, even to people who doesn't like space movies!I wish this movie never ends!

This is the movie which makes you read the science behind this story
and movie making too.I read the book of interstellar too ,its nothing
short of a physics book and I love it. Astronauts Matthew McConaughey
and Anne Hathaway journey to a distant galaxy on a desperate mission to
save humanity in this brainy, heartfelt, gorgeous and flawlessly acted
sci-fi epic.I am not telling the story or plot in this review but if
you want to experience something extraordinary and never seen before
please watch it.It is a wholly original movie that require audiences to
think .Dialogues are superb.It is a masterpiece.""Love is the one thing that transcends time and space."" The whole experience is astonishing.Acting,Direction,Music,
screenplay,Cinematography,animation in which they used maths everything
is superb. You will want more after the end though its a 3 hour long
movie.

One thing about Interstellar that is undeniable--it is a long movie. At
2 and a half hours you'd better strap in for the long haul. And with
the musical score the movie is like one long piano concerto. There was
not a moment too trivial for a portentous musical moment.Interstellar is about time, space and saving humanity. All three of
these items are connected. In the near future man is on the brink of
extinction because nothing will grow. The only viable solution is to
leave Earth behind and start anew on a new planet. Cooper (Matthew
McConaughey) volunteers to pilot an extremely risky mission to another
galaxy in search of mankind's new home.This movie involves science, astronomy, physics, and a lot of other
high level stuff that makes people like me say ""whoa you guys are
smart."" In between all of that were strong messages about love and
family and unbreakable bonds. At times the movie was down right
depressing and at other times it was uplifting and at all times it
seemed to try to pull tears out of you.This movie had elements of so many movies before it: Contact, Signs,
Abyss, Elysium but it never truly mimicked anyone of them. If you watch
this movie, be prepared for several recognizable appearances from known
actors and be prepared to weep.
"

I have always liked science fiction movies, and this one is pretty
good. Nice acting, as would be expected from accomplished actors like
Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, John Lithgow, and
many others. Great visuals, great score, and a partially good use of
the science involved, especially general relativity. We can pass on the
wormhole, a totally theoretical gravitational phenomenon. But they
completely ignored tidal gravity, meaning in an intensely strong
gravitational field, such as near a black hole's event horizon, or
crossing it, the force is so strong that it will pull the nearer side
of an object much more than the far side, thus tearing it apart down to
the atomic level well before reaching the event horizon. I'm sure that
this was glossed over because it would be fatal to the plot. But it is
still a pretty good movie.
"
263,9,"
I have been a cinema lover for a long time, Christopher Nolan is an
exceptionally great director and writer,his vision is marvellous.By
watching movie like Dark Knight trilogy,Inception, prestige and all
other titles of Nolan, anyone can judge that Interstellar really is the
masterpiece by Nolan. Conclusion was a way too fictitious but a nice
way to end the movie.I REALLY WANT TO SEE 2ND PART OF INTERSTELLAR but
its not possible. On the other hand, the graphics and acting both were
spectacular in the movie and i was speechless while watching the movie.
I remember the the dead silence in cinema when there was a blast in the
ship due to a** h**e DR MANN (nice acting bdw). That silence was
amazing and there was no music no sound nothing from the space and from
the IMAX. Interstellar is no doubt the best space movie of all time
yet. Graphics, Story, Acting, Concept and everyone related to movie
have done a marvellous, excellent and superb Job. Hats OFF Comparing to
biggest blunder of 2013, Gravity movie. Interstellar deserves more then
10 Oscars. There was no reason to give 7 Oscars to Gravity Movie.i
would still say the same thing that Gravity got stupid and sh***st
story of all time.
"

Did I like this film? Yeah..... Is it great? No not really...... The
first half of this film is excellent. We are given a compelling
scenario of a dying Earth which forces Matthew McConaughey to undertake
a real kinda pot luck mission for what's left of NASA. Character
development is quite good, with McConaughey and whatever his daughter's
name was. Michael Caine is also true to form and adds a real touch of
class. Now I could talk all day about the special effects, they really
are great..... Unfortunately, that doesn't really make that much
difference to me. Although, the scene with the black hole is pretty
cool. Anyway, the film goes along at a good pace and is exciting while
developing a story. Unfortunately, the film takes a bit of a negative
turn once they dig out Matt Damon, Seriously it wouldn't be the worst
call in the world to turn it off at this point. The film tries to
become more clever then it actually is. If you're one of these people
that is going to think I'm just picking holes in the film unnecessarily
then just look at the title of the film person! It's called
Interstellar! They travel between galaxies so it should be
Intergalactic! I like that the film tried something different so I
won't slate it or anything, just the idea of love seems very cheesy in
my opinion. I feel the film would have worked much better if the
underlying question was do you believe in God etc. As in we're faced
with the choice of do you believe God put us here and that we should
stay, or that it's purely scientific why we're here. If you've seen the
film Signs then you get what I mean when Mel Gibson talks about do you
believe in coincidences or something more. Anyway, a very enjoyable
film, has a story, has some good actors and performances, has a really
cool robot called TARS and provides us with some cool excitement. The
whole time change aspect when they're on the planet with the waves is
also very interesting. However, this film isn't perfect and the end
isn't as clever as some people think. I'd like to give 6.5 out of 10
but IMDb doesn't allow that!

I can say, without a shadow of doubt, that I enjoyed this movie. I
enjoyed all three hours of this movie. There are however some problems
that prevent me from giving it a higher overall rating. First off, one
that you may have heard before, has to do with the sound mixing. While
the score is great, it often drowns out the dialog making it hard to
hear anything that is being said, especially by the close to whispering
lead, Matthew McConaughey. The other problem I had was with some of the
scenes in general. The cast goes about doing things that, quite
frankly, you don't need to see. Set the tone with dramatic music though
and man do you have some intense button pressing. Otherwise, for a
movie that plays out like a sci-fi drama, it has a good dose of action
in it. Nothing over the top or even all that gruesome (something we've
come to expect in sci-fi these days). All together, its a great what if
story with plenty of fun and interesting new ideas. Both thumbs up.

Movie theaters are constantly trying to figure out how to get butts in
their seats. So they've added alcohol, better food, louder sound and
luxury reclining seats (the best innovation, IMHO). I have a solution
on how to get more butts into theater seats...Make more movies like INTERSTELLAR!Christopher Nolan's space epic was made to be seen on the big screen,
with big screen sound and visuals. It tells 2 stories in 1. The first
movie is a sci-fi thriller along the lines of CONTACT, GRAVITY and
2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The 2nd movie is a father/daughter relationship
story that brings much needed heart to the spectacle.Matthew McConaughy is well cast in the lead as Astronaut (and father)
Cooper. The ""McConnassaince"" continues as he is able to capture and
hold the screen against the stunning visuals and sound that is the
hallmark of this movie.Director Christopher Nolan continues his penchant for creating real
(not green screen) effects and it shows in the visceral nature of the
action scenes. The visuals are eye-popping, the sound is appropriately
jarring and the effect is stunning - especially a spinning space
station rescue scene that is every bit as ""roller coaster exciting"" as
was last year's GRAVITY.The father/daughter relationship between McConaughey and Jessica
Chastain is grounded and real, reminiscent of the relationship of Jodie
Foster and David Morse in CONTACT. Chastain grounds this movie on Earth
while McConaughey is driving through space. Her scenes with Michael
Caine, Casey Affleck and a surprisingly good Topher Grace make the
Earth-bound scenes terrific.But, make no mistake, the thrill of this movie is following Cooper and
fellow astronauts Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley and David Gyasli on their
quest to the stars to save the planet. Special notice should be made of
the vocal work that the always-interesting Bill Irwin does with the
robot TARS. He nearly steals this movie from his human co-horts, part
HAL, part R2-D2, without being annoying.The first 4/5 of this movie is a somewhat ""realistic"" sci-fi adventure,
while the last part is a fantastical ""what if"" through the wormhole,
reminiscent of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. I've heard complaints of this
part of the movie. My argument is this: if you've accepted the premise
of the first parts of this movie, then roll with the last part and
you'll be entertained, indeed.Just remember, you'll be MORE entertained if you catch this in a movie
theatre.9 (out of 10 stars) and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis).

Christopher Nolan, director of the Dark Knight series, takes a break
from the usual drenched-in-black movies he has brought us in the last
decade or so and tries his luck with space. The result? A little
confusing and a bit too loud, but nice to look at. Be sure to bring your earplugs.There's no denying it, the film is visually spectacular. From the
expanse of planet-side surfaces to the impressive spacecrafts and
zero-G interiors, arguably up there with the likes of Gravity - minus
Sandra Bullock's huffing and puffing, fortunately. You cannot fault the
work done here. Everything is perfectly polished and will look
breathtaking for those seeing it in IMAX. You'd like to think that great looks and great sound go hand in hand.
Well, not this time. Nolan's idea to 'create an idea of how loud it can
be in space', really, is not a good one. At times, the sound is so loud
that characters voice can't be heard. The score, even when provided by
renowned film composer Hans Zimmer, can drown out everything. A good
score is meant to aid great filmmaking, not hinder it.The story, likewise, can make or break it for some. It's ambitious and
is, while a bit disjointed, very well thought out. That' the 'make it'
part. The 'break it', for some, comes towards the end where the
narrative takes a very '2001: A Space Odyssey' turn. And as with that
film, some very thought-provoking ideas are brought up that, similarly,
can turn a few people off.Interstellar has so much potential, but is also full of it's up and
downs. An interesting, well thought out story that can get a little
confusing near the end, and well worth going to see just for the
visuals and, for those who like it, a little Matthew McConaughey
Southern drawl.
"
268,9,"
. . . or is it more of a high-tech remake of 1960's THE TIME MACHINE?
That is only one of many questions raised by INTERSTELLAR (beginning
with, ""Is it really so easy to drive a rusted-out Dodge Ram pick-up
truck on flat tires through green, roof-high corn stalks?""). Conflating
galaxy-connecting worm holes with galaxy-destroying black holes is the
least of INTERSTELLAR's brazen pseudo-science. Giving the Astronaut
Cooper character the ability to travel back decades in time, by-passing
all the Eloi-munching Morlocks, and then communicating with his
daughter via a wristwatch that doesn't look very dust resistant (and
which has been on a shelf all that time, in the Superbowl of Dust) may
strain the belief of some viewers. Furthermore, since Astronaut Romilly
knew in advance that he'd be alone in the mother-ship while his buddies
were gone a decade or two, why didn't he keep the gray out by setting
his sleep capsule on the ""hibernate indefinitely"" setting used by Matt
Damon's ""Dr. Mann""? The characters here state that humans were used for
this mission rather than robots exclusively because the former
improvise better. But you don't see C3PO wrestling R2D2 at the drop of
a space helmet as each new frontier is reached in STAR WARS. (This is
NOT the case for the people of INTERSTELLAR.) So give me those old time
robots, give me those old time robots, give me those old time robots,
they were good enough for Luke!
"

War, drought and famine plague the world of Interstellar. The wars have
ceased, but the fight for the basic essentials of life hang in the
balance. A blight threatens the food supplies and rolling dust storms
cause a dirt-filled existence for civilisation and the Cooper family.
Coop (Matthew McConaughey) is a farmer who is trying to help the
community and his family to survive. As a former pilot, engineer and a
recent widow, he is attempting to hold together the very existence of
his family. In amongst the trials of life, his daughter Murphy
(Mackenzie Foy) comes upon a strange anomaly that leads to a series of
events that push Coop into a situation that means the salvation of
mankind. He is asked to sacrifice his time on the earth by going
through a mysterious rip in the space-time continuum to find a new home
for humanity. He and a team of scientists, headed by Amelia Brand (Anne
Hathaway), leave earth to find new worlds that can sustain life. Once
on the spacecraft Endurance, the crew is confronted with many of the
realities of space travel and the nuances of traveling through time.
Reminiscent of the historical accounts of early explorers of this
world, they have to revert to instincts and their knowledge of the
universe to determine which steps to take and what sacrifices need to
be made for the salvation of mankind. Laid on a backdrop of space
exploration, philosophical and moral challenges occur within the team.
Being confronted with humanities biggest frailties and strengths, they
have to determine who to trust and where they need to go for the
benefit of humanity. Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Inception)
manages to weave a web of psychological drama on the backdrop of
science-fiction, reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters
of the Third Kind and Gravity. The notion of an original film from Christopher Nolan was exciting
after the experience of Inception. Interstellar seemed to be the next
frontier for his intellectual style of direction and writing. The
concept of climate change and war is ripped right out of today's
headlines and then overlayed with Kip Thorne's black hole theories make
for a fascinating mix of physics and science fiction. A mix that has
the potential for allowances for travel throughout time and space.
Nolan was able to make the storyline of Inception work, because he made
each jump in the film accessible for the audience. With the director
skill of previous Nolan experiences, this film seems destined for a new
level of filmmaking. Yet, there seemed to be some problems along the
way and the film became too clever for its own good. Not that it did
not work as a film, it merely did not have the fluidity of previous
Nolan films. It will be a film studied by many film classes in the
future, because of its philosophy and depictions of a world gone wrong.
The story, effects and acting delivered, but the combination feels like
too much for even three hours of cinema. Like the humorous MARS and
CASE robot characters, the time/space travel components felt clunky and
too dense to move the story along effectively. The special effects were
amazing and the cinematography was breathtaking at times, which was the
saving grace of moving the story along, but not enough to move this
from a good film to a great film. McConaughey, Hathaway and Jessica
Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty) did well with the roles they were given,
but suffered from the the large leaps in the story's time continuum.
With all of the tying off of the loose ends of the story added
laboriously to the already long film. The film will keep Nolan's
loyalists happy but will not appeal to the peripheral fans who have
known him for The Dark Knight trilogy. The writing team of Jonathan and Christopher Nolan tried to convey a
belief that mankind is the keeper of our own fate. The solution to the
problem of mankind is we will grow into a new conscience and develop
new abilities to manage the space and world in which we live. The
implication is that we hold the answers to the world's problems inside
ourselves. Humanity is it's own worst enemy, but we are also the
answer. This is probably why the story fell short of answering it's own
questions. It did get the problem correct, but missed finding the
answer. Interstellar opens the door to a multitude of deep questions
and a couple of the biggest being why is the world the way that it is
and how can we solve it? The Nolans seem to be going down the right
path in looking beyond ourselves with the introduction of the
supernatural 'They'. The inclusion of these unexplained characters in
the film even allow the scientists to look for supernatural answers.
Without giving too much away, their conclusion became an internal
answer with eternal implications. They attempt to eliminate God from
the equation, but the answer does not add up in the end. The direction
and writing became confusing. Was this a psychological thriller, a
philosophical art film or a groundbreaking science fiction epic? It was
not even clear if the Nolans knew how to describe the film which in the
end caused more confusion than entertainment. What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What is
the problem with the human condition? (Genesis 3, Matthew 15:19, Psalm
51:5) 2. What is the solution to the problem? (John 3:16-21) 3. Who
made the heavens? (Genesis 1:1-2:3, Exodus 31:13,17) Written by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system @

There always comes a time when children have to leave their parents. As
children of the Earth, human beings may someday have to face a
terrifying decision: leave mother Earth in search for a new home, or
remain here to die. In the film Interstellar, mankind approaches this
crossroad when the very dust of the Earth turns against us: a bleak
future that mirrors the dustbowl, but on a global scale. As the film
goes on, it becomes apparent that, thanks to the valor of the
characters, we will not ""go quietly into the night."" Space opera films
are slow-burners by nature, and Interstellar is no exception. Although
it runs more briskly than most, it still takes its time with the
narrative. The first act is dedicated solely to the Earth-based drama
(a bit along the lines of like The Right Stuff), which sets the scene
and the necessity for the mission that follows. Once the characters
reach space, the film's visual splendor emerges, offering stunning
views of Saturn, of wormhole travel, of far-away planets, and more. The
conflicts are subtle, but they come to a full boil towards the end,
before the film delivers a really bizarre reality-bending twist. The
denouement is ultimately satisfying, although it does leave off with a
few loose strands that the audience will have to reconcile on their
own.What makes Interstellar especially noteworthy will be its
creditability. Regardless of how far-out the plot goes, the film sports
some very real-looking designs for the spaceships, robots, and
Earth-based scenes. The depictions of black holes, wormholes, planets,
and all their related phenomenon (including the laws of gravity,
relativity, time, and extra dimensions) are handled far more
realistically than most other films on the market. The film even
manages to visually represent what a tesseract could look like; I
personally never thought that extra-dimensional space could be
portrayed on film at all, but Interstellar succeeds in a plausible
manner.Unfortunately, the experience may be spoiled for many by various
issues. The film has a penchant for exposition, including detailed
explanations of the science involved. There are moments where the music
and sound design drowns out the dialogue. There are moments where
characters act less than rational. The film also makes an overt attempt
to really yank on the audience's heartstrings. Whether or not these
same issues affect you may depend on your disposition on Christopher
Nolan's other work (in which a lot of the same issues are apparent,
especially in Inception), and the genre.Despite those contrivances and script issues, I found the story to be
quite impressive. It is a grand tale with a lot of big, high-concept
ideas. The film's story meticulously weaves the characters, plot, and
science in a tight knot. It is ultimately twisted around on itself to
form a complex, but easily-digestible moebius strip of a tale. What
makes it most endearing will be its characters, which show a tremendous
amount of heart and emotional power, and the themes. The film makes
some very bold assertions on human progress, suggesting that the stars
hold our destiny, in addition to overarching ideas of love, life, and
death.The film is well-made, featuring quality photography. There are
impressive visual moments throughout the film, but it's rarely
frivolous. Sharp and quick editing ensures that the film uses only what
it needs to for the storytelling. The actors do their jobs well:
Matthew McConaughey is quite spot-on as the main character, and I
enjoyed the performances of Anne Hathaway, and David Gyasi. I found
Matt Damon's and Wes Bently's characters the least endearing, but not
necessarily because of their performances. Michael Caine and John
Lithgow are effectively typecast in their signature smart-old-guy
roles. Despite all the clunky exposition, writing is pretty decent.
This production has really functional and real-looking sets, props, and
costumes. Special effects are phenomenal. Locales are great. Hans
Zimmer's music score is majestic and powerful, and really adds to the
experience. As noted before though, the mixing of the music, sound, and
dialogue could have been done better in some scenes.Not everybody will be captivated by Interstellar - some may find it
dull, overrated, annoying, contrived, or something. As far as space
operas go though, it is as strong of a film as Kubrick's 2001: A Space
Odyssey, with themes and intellect that can rival Tarkovsky's Solaris.
It is a natural evolution of Nolan's storytelling prowess, which he
exercised previously in Memento and Inception. For its strengths as a
story and film (and especially as a work of hard sci-fi), Interstellar
is worth seeing at least once.4.5/5 (Experience: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)

I absolutely loved every minute of this movie. Does it have a few small
issues? sure. but overall I was enthralled by the deep exploration of
scientific theory. It's important to understand that some elements of
this film are purely based on theory. A lot of people might be turned
off by the scene that takes place within a black hole singularity. That
scene reminds me of the early cubist work of Picasso and Broque. Both
instances are representative of multiple points in time being depicted
simultaneously. It's important to understand this is mostly
interpretive. The movie does go out of it's way to explain what's
theory and what isn't. However there is so much information packed into
this movie, that it's hard not to leave a few things out. That being
said, this is a very science heavy movie. If that's not your thing, you
might be better off seeing something more your speed. All of the actors do a fantastic job (even Hathaway and Damon, who's
characters are kind of irritating). The main characters do a good job
of really connecting you to the family element of the plot. The visuals are fantastic. There are a few sound issues with this film.
I think that was a creative choice, but it does not come across too
well, especially with dialogue in space.

The whole premise of Intersteller is wacko. That we would need to leave
the Solar System is faulty logic. NASA in 2005 proclaimed there is
enough material in the Asteroid Belt to create habitat to equal 30,000
earths(that's 30,000 X 58 million sq mi(land mass)) and house hundreds
of trillions of future humans in the Goldie Locks Zone. That ain't all!
If we humans decide to use all the moons of Jupiter, Saturn and the
other gas giants as well Pluto, Venus, Mercury, the Kuiper Belt, and
the Oort Cloud and the gas of the gas giants, we could support millions
of habitat big and small equal to 200,000 earths and more(think O'Neil
Cylinder, Stanford Torus, up to McKendree Cylinders). This would
support up to 1 and 1/2 quadrillion humans/cyborgs in the future. The
only reason to leave the Solar System and start to branch out across
the Milky Way would be fear of roving black holes, or stars. Other than
roving black holes and stars we have a home in the Solar System for the
next 2 billion years at the least. It is estimated that at the current
rate of growth it will take 500 years to reach the first trillion
humans/cyborgs. Let's say we spread to the nearest 10 solar systems.
Those solar systems will not need habitable planets. We will
manufacture habitat enough to house a quadrillion humans/cyborgs around
each star. It will take thousands of years, but we have time.

I remember I watched it immediately after I finished my final
examination, a time when my classmates all devoted their time to
singing in the karaoke or wandering in the shopping mall. Nevertheless,
I chose to watch this movie all afternoon long. After watching, I was
so excited that I could not wait to announce to everyone that I have
watched Interstellar and it was so amazing. Indeed, watching this film
is like going through a brainstorm. Interstellar has well included and
mingled the interpretation of parental love, universal love and insight
of how the world and universe function, which I found a little
perplexing and confused. Because to fully understand Interstellar
really needs the inkling of physics and the theory of relativity as
well as other advanced knowledge about the universe. Besides, the
accuracy and discretion involved in this movie are really remarkable,
like the image of black whole, the singularity and the envision of
five-dimension space. I really hope that more movie like interstellar
could be created to publicize the advanced knowledge about physics and
universe.

Let's face itwhen it comes to visuals, Christopher Nolan is up there
with some of the best directors today (Spielberg, Cameron, etc.). But
when it comes to writing, why can't Christopher and his screen writing
brother, Jonathan, hire some professional writers to hash out their
ideas and sculpt them into a professional screenplay? It's through
their insistence on doing all the work themselves, that we end up with
the bloated 'Interstellar'.It becomes apparent in the first act just how amateurish the Nolan
brothers really are. They posit a future world where climate conditions
have turned earth into a virtual dust bowl, on the brink of extinction.
Enter Cooper, widowed former astronaut who must save earth from
destruction. It's imperative that Cooper get to his space journey in
Act Two as quickly as possible, so we can find out what the solution to
earth's conundrum is in a reasonable amount of time. But no, the
Nolan's insist on dragging things out so that Act I is all interminable
exposition.We're introduced to Cooper's family who go on a long-winded drive
through a corn field with a flat tire, chasing a mysterious drone.
Later, Cooper's 10 year old daughter, Murphy, discovers a 'ghost' in
the dust, which turns out to be a coded message from benign aliens who
seek to rescue mankind from their big problem on earth (why the aliens
are so helpful is never explained but it's rather convenient that
stricken earth has someone in their corner!). Cooper and Murphy are led to the secret NASA installation where we're
treated to tortured explanations about binary codes, a wormhole which
might lead to three different planets on the other side, possibly
hospitable to earth colonists, and a very Twilight Zone-like
""gravitational time dilation"", where one hour on the surface of one of
the planets that's too close to the wormhole, equals 7 earth years.
Throughout the film, it's much more 'tell' than 'show' as the Nolan's
insist on explaining all the science behind what's happening,
undoubtedly provided mostly by the film's consultant, theoretical
physicist Kip Thorne. I was squirming in my seat since it took so long to get to the meat and
potatoes of the story: whether Cooper and his crew find out if any of
the three planets prove hospitable for earth colonization. Indeed, Act
2 features what Nolan is good at: action scenes featuring some
fantastic visuals. On the first planet, prepare yourself as Cooper and
crew battle a giant tsunami and later on Planet 2 when Matt Damon, as
Mann, a villainous astronaut, attempts to kill Cooper by smashing his
visor and then hijacks a shuttle craft and unsuccessfully attempts to
dock with the mother ship.Unfortunately, 'Interstellar' features a hokey climax where a now grown
Murphy must figure out how NASA space ships can be launched via
gravity. Initially, she's despondent when the leader of the NASA
project, Brand (Michael Cane), admits that his equation to launch the
space ships was bogus. But somehow (and don't ask me how), if Murphy is
able to glean additional data from the black hole's 'singularity', she
can solve the equation. Enter Cooper who has left (love interest)
Amelia, his good-looking co-astronaut, to touch down on the third
planet, while he somehow tries to figure out how to communicate with
the aliens, so he can send Murphy the crucial data.Again, but don't me ask how, despite the fact that Cooper is out of
fuel in his shuttle and finds himself floating in space, he ends up in
an extra-dimensional spatial dimension where he's able to communicate
with Murphy by sending Morse Code through a watch she had as a child.
Cooper is assisted by his robot, TARS, who awkwardly resembles a
triple-hinged Gumby. Man and robot successfully communicate with Murphy
who is now able to save earth by completing Brand's equation.Nolan's message, however, has nothing to do with the fictional
salvation of humanity. Quite the contrary, it's all about 'family'.
Cooper's promise to meet up with Murphy after his journey, is
fulfilled. The problem is, due to that gravitational time dilation,
Murphy is an old woman, now on her deathbed. Cooper and daughter still
get to bond and she smartly tells Cooper to join Amelia on the third
planet, where presumably they can live happily ever after. 'Interstellar' shines only when Nolan pulls out all the stops with his
fantastic visuals. Story wise, a narrative replete with benign aliens
and wormholes, is straight out of the original Star Trek play-book.
Nolan doesn't help things with all the science-speak, that slows the
action down considerably. With judicious editing, 'Interstellar' could
have been a better picture but the premise behind it all, is
unfortunately that some may term, a 'reverie of adolescence'.

I don't normally write reviews .... i really don't ... what i do is to
read reviews and relie on them to judge my movie selection .... BUT
interstellar was a movie , which I saw in IMAX (no credits to imax btw
everyone can shoot in 70mm film) that was so intense , so different
..... there was nothing like this before . I saw a movie and i expected
it to be good , like i expected Avatar to be good but no! its different
, it is different to anything we do , we experience , we feel ....
INTERSTELLAR is so intense , filled with drama , filled with story ,
filled with thoughts. I never saw a movie that took me to that edge ,
of beein a human just living on this planet trying to understand this
galaxy . For me this is the best Movie ever , because it shows
different situations , that we could reach... or not .... different
experience . this movie should open a lot of peoples eyes . It did for
me in a different way because im more into the whole space and universe
world then most are but still ..... why are you here ...... if u are
not important you would be vanished. Think about your place in earth
.... how you could make it a better one and how you are a part of the
evolution.to everyone who ""doesnt understand the movie"" .... you will be
separated by natural selection and don't worry you wont suffer .btw , my new favourite movie !!!! into the galaxys , Sebastian

So I got around to seeing this yesterday, and really enjoyed it. I do
like Christopher Nolan's films, and I would rate this as his fifth
effort  behind ""Inception,"" ""Momento"" and the first two Batman films.
In ""Interstellar,"" Nolan reaches for the stars, and has created a
sci-fi movie for the ages... almost. The result isn't quite the ""2001""
of this generation, but I do think that sci-fi from this point on will
need to aim high in terms of ideas and concepts presented in films,
which is going to be amazing for sci-fi fans.Set around 40-50 years in the future, life on Earth is fast approaching
its use by date, as food is running out due to a number of factors. The
discovery of a worm-hole near Saturn presents scientists with the
possibility that humanity may be able to continue on an Earth-like
planet on the other side of the wormhole. To that end, the Endurance
mission follows up the earlier Lazarus missions, which were a series of
manned missions seeking worlds that might be able to sustain human
life. What follows is a lot of science and drama, with an ending which
was a bit 2001, and will have fans of the film debating various aspects
of the film until the end of time.Taking two years to reach Saturn, before traversing through the
wormhole, the Endurance encounters the first of three targeted planets;
Miller, which is an ocean planet where tsunamis the size of
sky-scrappers appear to be a regular occurrence, Also, due to Miller's
close proximity to a Black Hole, the gravity of the planet means that
for every hour on the surface of the planet, seven years elapses back
on Endurance, orbiting the planet. By the time Cooper and Brand return
to orbit, 23 years have passed on Endurance.With much of the Endurances resources exhausted as a result of this leg
of the mission, the crew must decide between one of the remaining two
planets, or give up on the idea of returning to Earth. Mann is chosen,
where the crew find and revive Dr Mann, the leader of the Lazarus
missions. His glacier covered planet turns out to be unsuitable, and
his data was faked in the hope of being rescued. In an attempt to
hijack the mission, Mann meets his doom, along with one of the other
characters.Following a daring return to Endurance, which is now hopelessly low on
fuel, Cooper pilots the ship, so it sling shots around the black-hole,
launching it towards Edmund, the third planet, but launching himself
into the black-hole in the process. It was a bit 2001 at this point, as
Cooper finds himself in a dimension where time is not linear. Cooper
then finds a way to communicate with the adult Murph, giving her
information that allows for the space station being constructed on
Earth to be launched, thus allowing for the eventual evacuation and
relocation to the new world. Having completed his mission, Cooper then
miraculously finds himself floating in space, back on other side of the
wormhole, having become a fetal being enclosed in a transparent orb of
light floating in space gazing at the Earth... I'm just gagging. Cooper
is in fact floating in space, near Saturn, and is rescued by NASA
rangers, who deliver him to a large space station, a further 50-60
years into the future. He reunites with his elderly daughter, who on
her death bed, tells him to go back through the worm hole and find
Brand, who has set up camp on Edmund, but is all alone. The performance of the cast was very good, with Matthew McConaughey
dominating the film throughout. Anne Hathaway was good, although I
can't help but feel that perhaps Nolan could have used someone a few
years older, especially since it's revealed that her character had a
relationship with one of the Lazarus astronauts, whom had embarked on
his mission 10 years before the Endurance mission. Michael Caine is
usually good in everything he does. Matt Damon's cameo was good too,
although similar to Hathaway, perhaps the director could have used
someone older. In terms of the presentation of the film, it was beautifully shot, as
you would expect a film with such a large budget to be. The scenery on
Mann, which was filmed in Iceland, was quite spectacular. The musical
score by Hans Zimmer was out of this world, and will possibly get a few
nods when awards' season rolls around. I liked the story as a whole a lot, although it did contain a few plot
holes. Some questions I found myself asking at the end of the movie
included things like; how could NASA execute such a large and costly
mission without the public knowing? Why was the first planet (Miller)
given the thumbs up given that it was completely covered by water?
Given the length of time spent on the Miller leg of the mission, would
NASA (or somebody else) not have launched another mission? Finally,
with the space station positioned near the worm-hole, why hasn't anyone
else gone through it? Overall, the film is highly entertaining, and will do ridiculously well
at the box office, so much so that a sequel might possibly come about.
I do think many reviewers are getting a bit carried away by awarding
this film a 10, which clearly it is not.For me, this is a 7. The scope
of this film is grand and ambitious, but it does fall short of being
great. I'll probably go and watch it again, mostly in the search for
answers I know I probably want get. I do recommend the film to sci-fi
buffs, and also for Matthew McConaughey fans, but if you don't fall
into either category, the film is three hours long, so you should
probably steer clear of it.

This movie was great and I loved it. It had some flaws, such as how it
sacrifices story for exposition, but all in all, it was an enjoyable
experience. That was until the big Shyamalan twist which ruined the
entire movie. For a movie that likes to brag about how scientifically
accurate it is, it sure took a big deuce on it. The universe library
time-line thing was really far-fetched and with the rest of the movie
being mostly believable (at least to the common person), it was so out
of place.The sad part is that the writer was probably so proud when they came up
with that plot twist.
"
278,7,"
I will try hard to NOT include any spoilers but checked the box in case
I let something inadvertently slip.First off, I am a science fiction addict. Have been since I was 7 years
old and I am now 62. I liked science so much I became a scientist! As
it turned out, science is not quite the magical, mystical world I had
envisioned during my childhood but it is a whole lot of fun. I have
found biochemistry, physics, pharmacology and computer science to be
very satisfying fields of study. I am also a believer in God (or
whatever else you might wish to call Him/Her) because, without God,
biochemistry, pharmacology and physics don't make much sense. And yes,
I try to stay cutting edge WRT video, audio, flying (drones) and
technology in general. I say all this so you will get an idea of where
I am coming from...This film's trailers enticed me since I immediately thought ""Contact""
meets ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" with a homespun, ""Good Old
Boy"" philosophy, brought on by Matthew McConaughey in the lead role. In
fact, they do talk about the ""The Hitchhiker's Guide"" a couple of times
in the movie! Though there is some, albeit odd and over- burdening to
my suspension of disbelief, ""science,"" if you will, it is mostly based
on buzzwords and inconsequential pop-culture philosophies about space
and time. And there are a few times/scenes where this is taken to
extremes and it turns out to be just silly. Overall, the acting is good. As expected, McConaughey is McConaughey;
always good for some laughs and some minor introspection, but for the
most part, just the cool guy next door, if you live in Texas. Anne
Hathaway is also good as his copilot. As usual, Jessica Chastain is a
great actress and gorgeous to boot! Gotta love JC! Outshining everyone
in the cast however, is newcomer (at least to me) 14 yo Mackenzie Foy,
who plays MM's 10 yo daughter, Murphy. She is cute, terribly
intelligent and street smart. And to a certain degree MMs favorite kid.
She is very engaging as a brilliant little girl and also as an old soul
(which can mean many things in a time/space warping movie ;-) )The bottom line for me: Interstellar is an entertaining movie with with
an accomplished cast and an engaging, if somewhat unbelievable and, at
times,cheesy, plot. It is also about 40 minutes too long. I liked it in
the theater and will likely watch the DVD when it's available! I do not
hesitate to recommend Interstellar to families (kids 13+ yo) or as a
good date night film.As always, just my opinion, YMMV ;-)

PhD in physics required prior to viewing this movie. All I got out of
it was that they were in a spaceship. The excessively loud soundtrack
was super helpful with understanding McConaughey's soft voice although
apparently it was the directors intention for the audience to not
understand the movie and be forced to turn on subtitles. Highly
recommend for those of you who love to be confused. Super awesome
parenting skills by giving his kids 10 minutes notice that he will be
going into space for the next 100 years and possibly leaving them to
their inevitable death and decay on Earth. Sort of wondering how
everyone else gave this a 10/10. Maybe they all like to pretend they
didn't fail physics and can still understand these concepts that are
intangible to us common folk.

Nolan is a GENIUS and this may be his Magnum Opus to date! This piece
is an absolutely incredible weaving of over-the-top acting from both
the lead and supporting cast, and intellectually and emotionally
compelling story-telling, supplemented by a score that MOVES you to the
edge of tears, like a chorale praising the glory of God from Johann
Sebastian Bach. The CGI is mind-blowing, and Nolan's precision with the
laws of physics and the observations made by the scientific community
to compose this visual masterpiece, is sublime. It is a celebration of
all the scientific, philosophical, and artistic accomplishments of the
modern era. Ten out of ten! Best Picture of 2014! If you haven't
watched it yet, I don't know what you're doing there sitting down and
reading this. Go NOW!

The greatest excitement was to watch this movie in the premiere day
here in Skopje. As a space geek I could't miss that! For surely I
waited for far too long (since announcing the first trailer of
Interstellar) to convince myself that I'm speaking the truth about who
will win the Oscar this year ... In a couple of months there will be
""And now the Academy Award for Best Picture goes to Interstellar!""
Interstellar send us a message about humanity. The answers lie within
us all. Because the world is changing and it does every time. We must
accept that change and save the mankind in a way that lies deep in each
of everyone at this planet.

Interstellar ReviewAnyone remember Avatar? You know, the best selling movie of all time
the was basically Pocahontas in space? The movie that is accepted as
one of the best sci-fi movies ever? I have news for you, Avatar has
been beat.I don't know why I'm only realizing this now, but Avatar has actually
been bested (as far a quality goes) multiple times this year alone.
Hell, Guardians of the Galaxy was easily better than ""Quest of Blue
Monkey Cats.""I suppose I am noticing because Interstellar is the first sci-fi space
adventure that I truly loved since Avatar. (To be fair, there haven't
been many of those in recent years). Let me explain:By the way, there could be Spoilers. Maybe.PlotDescribing the plot of this movie without spoiling too much is going to
be like playing a game of Minesweeper. Here we go.Interstellar stars Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway (among others)
in a future where Earth is dying. Farming and food is the priority for
every person on the planet. Blights and Famines have ravaged the
countrysides, killing crops and creating a 21st Century dust bowl.
People are starving and the world is desperate for a solution.In comes Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a farmer, engineer, and former
NASA pilot. He is also a beloved father. After discovering a secret
NASA base, Cooper is enlisted by his old mentor to lead a mission
through a wormhole to find potential planets to relocate to. Much to
the dismay of his family, Cooper agrees to the journey, and shortly
after, lakes off towards the wormhole.At this point you are about twenty minutes into an almost three hour
long movie. Unfortunately, this is as far as I've decided to summarize
this time. The rest of the movie is something you need to experience
for yourselves. The rest of the movie is just constant thrill and
emotion. Matt Damon shows up at some point; it gets weird.ActingWhat a cast. Seriously, everyone in this movie is fantastic (Yes, even
Hathaway). I felt that in some moments McConaughey's performance felt
too forced, but for the most part he was okay. Note: Do not go see this movie for the acting. Even though the
performances are great, the movie is more about an exciting journey and
heart-touching story.SFX/ActionInterstellar looks gorgeous. Outer space and all the planets look
amazing. There are several scenes in the movie that are so thrilling
just because of the scenery and SFX. I want to tell you about them, but
instead you should really just see the movie.Award Time!Best Performance: Matt Damon as Dr. Mann.Best Scene: The emergency docking scene (you'll know the one).Best Planet: The ocean planet.ConclusionFrom the outside, Interstellar may just look like a space adventure.
Although that is true, Interstellar is more than that. It has a
thrilling, heartwarming, and thought-provoking narrative that had me
literally on the edge of my seat the whole time. I give Interstellar a
9.5/10. Please go see this movie and scratch that sci-fi itch that I
know has been bothering you.
"

First off, I won't urge you to go see the movie. In fact, don't go.
Because, if you hesitate and wait for some random dude on the Internet
to make you want to see it, then feel free to skip this review. It's
not for you. This is for those who've already decided to see it and
just want to please their inner nerd by reading and learning as much
about it as they can, but not too much - just right on the edge of the
point of no return: those nasty spoilers. This is also for those who've
already watched it and just want to please their inner nerd by
comparing notes.Still with me? Good. I should start by saying that this is my first and probably my last
review I'll ever write here. And I've been waiting a very long time for
this moment. So long, I almost thought it would never come. But here I
am now, struggling to find those gut-hitting words to describe the
experience that is Interstellar. And what an experience it is! I won't
go into specifics, others have already done it. I'll only tell you just
that  my experience with this masterpiece of a film. Now, if there's one thing you should know about me, it's that watching
and reading about movies is one of my deepest passions. I even have
friends telling me my passion borders on obsession. They're wrong. It
crossed that line long ago. And despite being only 23 years old, I'm
the biggest, most knowledgeable movies fan I know of. I went to the
movies hundreds of times. But this was the first time I felt I needed to stand up and start
applauding!Well, thank God this guy behind me beat me up to it, cuz he ended up
looking like an idiot for 5 very slow and awkward seconds in front
(technically ""back"") of all those people! Of course I didn't want to
look as stupid as him, so naturally I didn't do it. But I gotta tell
you, resisting that temptation was extremely hard, simply because
Interstellar is just that good. It's just STELLAR. It not only ticks all the right boxes - being emotional, beautiful,
thrilling, captivating, and even mind-blowing - but it goes above and
beyond the genius of human potential only to return and remind us
about our genius potential for humanity.Thank you, Nolan.P.S. You're totally forgiven for the TDKR fiasco.P.P.S. Yeah, I'm a Nolan fanboy. So what?

Put hard sci-fi name, is not possible technological developments or

the philosophy that uses theater genre. This style may seem boring to

cinema while still attached to science advancing fearlessly go before
extraordinary land of the revolutionary sci-fi movies it is rare enough
to be considered a single hand. Previously, these films created by
audiences and critics have seen anywhere like the mass of the world,
what the brain can detect the true work of art with a defiant courage
to do this much surprised, of course. Maybe that's why the average take
criticism in that period films fall into this vision, 'ridiculous' and
'unreasonable' are thrown aside given the stamp.Kubrick in 1968 2001: When A Space Adventure for release audience and
critics that compels both the cinematic language, they were baffled as
well as to what humanity's potential future with a film examining it in
detail to do. During this period, the cinema audience by swearing in
the middle of the film, it was not hard to find critics of the 2001 hit
from place to place. But ten years later, Kubrick's film is not only
technically referred to as a masterpiece, in its place in the context
of humanity and the universe as a philosophical examining a profound
work of art known integrity. In 2001, Kubrick's vision into real /

'beyond' If we keep in mind diving into interstellar looks like we will
talk about for a long time. The final film in the US than even some of
the critics of invective about to be released, I and some of them I

audience. Even after the first ten minutes of story elements quoted
fragment ends expertly avoiding to give important details about the
film. In this regard, we know that only Cooper, played by Matthew

where the family had to leave his beloved daughter to go into space.
Make sure, before entering the hall you satisfied with this close

to touch compared with other techniques I detail of Nolan cinema.
First, before technically more clinical and critically acclaimed Nolan

took the story beyond the solar system, although, as in last year's
massive gravity space manages to describe in a realistic manner

staying alone with a tremendous shot and Hans Zimmer music.Ten-twenty years after critics and cinema release a sci-be called

Christopher Nolan's Interstellar is by far 2014's best science fiction
as well as being one of the best science fiction movies of all time
along with 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Planet of the Apes (1968),
Star Wars (1977) (along with The empire strikes back (1980)), Close
Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T. (1982), Alien (1979), Aliens
(1986), Avatar (2009), Minority Report (2002), Gravity (2013), The
Avengers (2012), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and all three of the
Iron Man movies (2008-2013). Out of all the movies that I just listed
it reminds me of Grvity when it comes to the emotions of the characters
but this movie telling more of a story, and as well as 2001 when it
comes to the visuals.The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper a
farmer whose daughter Murph (played by Mackenzie Foy)notice that there
is drought and famine that leads to dust storms and then they are led
to NASA where they will meet a man named Professor Brand (played by
Michael Caine) who convinces Cooper to go on the mission to save earth
and he then agrees to it but hates the feeling of leaving his children
behind without seeing them grow up for many years but luckily they have
their grandfather (played by John Lithgow) who watches them for the
rest of his life. Christopher Nolan's direction and his script
(co-written by his brother Jonathan Nolan) are just perfect for the
movie to have, and not only that but even Hans Zimmer's suspenseful
score is amazing. At this past Oscars ceremony this movie got 5 well
deserved Oscar nominations but the only Oscar that it went off with was
for visual effects when I think it deserved a whole lot more in my
personal opinion. Even the cast delivers great and top notch
performances not only from McConaughey, Caine, and Lithgow, but also
from Anne Hathaway, Casey Affleck, Jessica Chastain, David Oyelowo as
the principal that his kids went to school to, William Devane (who
appears on the Rosland Capital commercials) and one of the people who
work at NASA, Matt Damon, Topher Grace, and David Gyasi as one of the
crew members on the mission. The final scene in this movie was
complicated but harrowing at the same time where Murph (this time
played by the legendary Ellen Burstyn) is in the hospital when Cooper
is 124 years old but is still young. This is one of 2014's very best
films.

This movie is excellent, and it has some great special effects. The
acting was also good, i got sucked into the movie right from the start,
that's what i call movie-magic. There's not many movies or producers
can do this so big shout-out to Christopher Nolan! I saw no flaws to
the movie and the movie is very original, i haven't seen any movie like
this before, the idea is brand new for the movie and its perfect. The
question many people ask ""How will the earth and the humans be in 100
years(or longer)"" and i like how this movie shows possibilities over
what can actually happen, cause nobody has any idea whats happening in
a 100 years. I also like the ""more than 3 dimensional"" talk in it, all
in all its a good movie and i recommend a watch. This movie gets 10/10
from me because its a long movie with a lot of as i would like to call
them ""tear"" scenes and ""joy"" scenes, it brings you so far into the
movie and its great! Written by John.

I am at a loss to understand why so many people liked and reviewed
positively this movie. I find it scandalous that it appears to have
more positive reviews than Gravity by Alfonso Cuarón which is a giant
compared to this dwarf, in all aspects including acting, story line,
dialogs and the visual effects. The performance of all the actors is
average but the mumblings of the main character,Matthew McConaughey,
are so incomprehensible and annoying. The computer graphics always play
a big role in a science fiction movie. Unfortunately the director
failed even to capitalize on it and the resulting visual effects are
just average. In short, please do watch this movie if you want to see
for yourself how a great amount of time, energy and money can be spent
to insult human intelligence in guise of science.

This is an astonishing piece of work from Nolan. I was hooked in from
the start until the end. My attention never wondered from the screen at
any point and the almost 3 hour running time sailed by. I've heard
criticism coming from 2001 A Space Odyssey fans towards this movie. If
this movie had been made by Kubrick then those same people would say
it's a masterpiece! The criticism seems to be aimed at Interstellar's
final act which people find hard to accept. It's a movie guys!! To be
honest, I loved the final act, it was sensational. Let me go back to
2001's final act...a star baby! Yeah, that's really believable!
Interstellar is a masterpiece of the highest order.

The Hans Zimmer music is spectacular in this movie. Without a doubt
this will be a classic movie for years and years. Not going to ruin the
story, its science fiction. there is not an over use of CGI. I thought
it was better than inception, which I also liked. Both movies had a
play on the perception of time, other worlds. Unlike inception, this
movie had a strong tug at the heart with a lot of emotion. The very
fact so many people are talking about this movie will make you want to
go and see it. Also its really a movie you have to watch on the big
screen. Its well done. the nearly 3 hours was good, it did it justice.

This was a great science fiction movie - This movie had a similar feel
of 2001 Space Odyssey - however Interstellar had a much thicker plot
with emotion and human interaction tied in. The acting was believable
which added to the realism of the plot-Matthew McConaughey did a great
job as the lead. Well written movie with a plot that kept you on the
edge of your seat. Hard to believe the movie was 169 minutes- went by
fast. If you like movies that make you think for a few days after you
see it - this is a movie for you. Supporting characters were believable
and added to the overall plot with realism. There was no ""overacting""
by the cast which also helped the credibility of the movie.

This is a film that demands your viewing; visually, emotionally, and
mentally. Do not let that scare you, let it entice you and draw upon
your wonder of the unknown and the curiosity of discovery. I suggest
you see this film with someone, whether that be a friend, family, or
significant other. Prepare for a few tears, a few laughs, and prepare
to be baffled and mesmerized. This is a film that pushes many limits,
and some might say the limits of its audience, but I see that as a
positive.This film will remind you of 2001, The Tree of Life, Apollo 13, and
Insomnia. For those looking for the link to Christopher Nolan's other
work Insomnia is your best bet; this carries all of the same acting,
writing, and directing marvels of that film. Dark knight fans may be
shied away, and fans looking for the action of Inception may leave
feeling cheated, but ignore them. This is a film for people. It is a
personal and human film. It's most tender moments will cause views to
draw on emotions and relationships in their own life. It reaches beyond
the screen; asking some very personal, as well as philosophical
questions. The film in the end may not have all the answers, or even
explain itself completely, but is does not suffer from these aspects,
but rises higher because of them. The movie is not perfect, but it is not supposed to be perfect. Just
like the first maps drawn, or the first exploration into unknown
waters, there will be missteps and wrong turns. I am keeping this short
to avoid giving anything away. Go see this film with an open mind, and
it will reward you in every way. It is a giant step forward in modern
cinema, it is a film that will be discussed for years to come, and it
is a film that has the power to affect the viewer, something not many
films in today's market can boast. I cannot remember the last time a
movie truly left me speechless. There have been films I have wanted to
watch again right away, films I needed to process, or films that had me
deep in thought. This film not only achieved all of the above, but
truly and honestly left me speechless. The film will demand a great
deal of the viewer, including the three hour runtime, but like any
great adventure the reward at the end is greater than the sum of its
parts.

I'm a Huge fan of Christopher! I've been waiting for this movie since I
heard about Matthew teaming up with Christopher for their new movie. I
don't have words to explain about this movie. This movie is a
masterpiece, based on the importance of the humanity. How important our
species to us? Whom will you save when you get the edge of your life?
Is it the Species or its just your family or you save yourself and
leave others?! Do you follow your heart or your mind? These are the
questions we face when we watch this movie! Cast is excellent!
Christopher explained about a theory, theory which says that we are not
alone! There are beings out there who are Superior to us or it's just
us(THEY) who will evolve in the future! One thing is for sure, the
person who's going to watch this movie should have some imagination
skills and a good grip on Physics!!! I got a lot to tell but I don;t
want to spoil the Surprise!!!! Go watch it!!!!!!!!! Don't miss
it!!!!!!!! One in a Decade Movie!!!!!

I'm not going to review the movie, but I will review the flawed/easily
manipulated Rating system this site has become. As I write this, the
movie supposedly has over 12000 independent movie-going-public votes -
even though the general release of the movie in the U.S. is not until
tomorrow and the international release is occurring now. And,
apparently, well over 11000 of those votes gave this movie a 10 out of
10 rating because the overall rating is 9.3 - that would mean that not
only is Interstellar the best movie ever made in the history of cinema,
but it is far and away the best movie ever made and movies such as The
Godfather, Gone with the Wind, etc. are only average by comparison.
There are two other possibilities. The first is these 12000 voters have
seen only a few movies and they were so bad that this one seemed
perfect by comparison. Or the entire voting process is manipulated by
filmmakers to produce artificially high ratings to dupe potential
ticket buyers. Spoiler Alert: It's not the best movie ever made.

I would say that this is a good movie but not great. I love these kinds
of movies. I loved Contact (Robert Zemeckis), felt transported. Again
felt transported by Sunshine (Danny Boyle), but did not feel
transported by this movie. I was aware at all time I'm watching a
movie. I'm not sure exactly why but probably part to some bad acting,
bad storytelling and some very bad choices.*** Spoilers *** ahead. Stop reading.Casting Matt Damon was probably too much. I also didn't like the robot.
It didn't feel realistic at all. Nolan trying to have something
different went too far. No way I can accept that a big ridiculous wall
is a reasonable shape for an intelligent walking robot. It screams look
how clever we are.Also it was a bad idea to cast Ellen Burstyn as old Murph. That's the
most important emotional moment of the movie and immediately you feel
it's someone else, it's not Murph. I think even if they had used
Jessica Chastain in a bad old makeup, it would have been better.

I went to the theater with high expectations about this movie and I can
say that it is incredible. After watching the movie I was thinking a
lot of what I saw on the movie and went to YouTube and found that all
you see of the movie are actually theories about space and some other
things are real. So feel like an explorer out there in the space. It is
indeed a good lesson about space and things that we as humans know so
far at this point. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes
sci-fi movies and space. I will watch this movie again because I
probably missed some details. The music you hear throughout the music
is very good and makes you feel that you are in the spaceship.

And i thought Christopher Nolan couldn't do better than Inception...but
this without a doubt topped the list. I've watched the trailer many
times and heard a lot about the movie before going...had so much
expectations and what i saw exceeded all my expectations... It's a
movie that's gonna 'literally' blow your mind and boost up your
adrenaline to very high levels...it fully gets your attention for 170
minutes... Everything about the movie is really excellent...the story
line, the acting specially from Matthew McConaughey, the visuals, and
of course as always the music from the brilliant Hans Zimmer. It's
really one of my all time best movies

Another masterpiece by Nolan. This movie take us into a beautiful and
exciting journey through space in order to save mankind from
extinction. It's not just another movie in space and about space. It's
something more.It has everything we like and want - excellent story, excellent cast
and excellent directing.And most important it has a really good and unexpected end, which is
kinda hard to find in these type of movies these days.Without a doubt one of the best of the year if not the best. Hope
finally Nolan wins that statue

of the best I have ever seen.Bad reviews are from people that always complain because this is what

Does not contain spoilers, just some information about what the movie
is about.I have just watched this movie, I am writing this review as it has been
2 hours since it finished. And I am still in some sort of trance
because of Interstellar, my mind is blown.Interstellar starts off by showing a realistic possible future of human
Kind on planet earth. It gives you an idea what people are going
trough.As the movie progresses it becomes clear that humans try to find a way
to survive by exploring the universe and exploring black holes. With
this extremely dangerous and interesting voyage, Interstaller delivers
many emotions: Humanity, Love, desperation. This all with an
understanding of the universe (it sounds a little vague, I know) It's
hard to put to words. The extreme complexity of the universe shown in
this movie really, REALLY makes you think. Though maybe the complexity
of this movie might be hard to understand, I believe it's what makes it
so great.This movie is a MasterpieceI didn't watch any trailers beforehand, and I advice not to read any
information about it. The given ratings and reviews on Interstellar
should be enough reason to go watch it. I won't be talking any more
about it, since I believe watching a movie (or movies in general) with
as little given information as possible gives you the greatest
experience.

Christopher Nolan directs an enthralling space odyssey, co-written with
his brother Jonathan. This movie lives up to the hype and is one not to
be missed. The earth is chocking as it is a starving Dirt Bowl. The
future is dim as farmers are producing less and less to feed the
population. Cooper(Matthew McConaughey)is a former test pilot and
widower raising two children, fifteen year old Tom(Timothee Chalamet)
and ten year old Murph(Mackenzie Foy), who is suspended from school for
fighting. She refuses to believe the school books being right, saying
the Apollo missions were faked in order to bankrupt Russia's space
program.Cooper and daughter stumble across the remnants of the believed to be
defunct NASA, where Professor Brand(Michael Caine) convinces Cooper he
is the only one to command a mission to be launched into space in
search of a new planet that can sustain life. The flight must enter a
wormhole that will warp time, but allow a crew to rescue data from
explorers, who preceded them. A member of Cooper's mission is Brand's
daughter(Anne Hathaway). Deep on the mind of Cooper's daughter is the
fact that if and when her father makes it back to earth, he will be the
same age or older than her due to the time warp.No little green men, no aliens in sight. There are a couple of highly
intelligent computerized robots, so to speak. Visually awesome and
enhanced by Hans Zimmer's score. McConaughey seems driven and invested.
Young Miss Foy is very watchable. And Jessica Chastain is excellent in
the role of the adult Murph. Also in the cast: John Lithgow, Wes
Bently, Matt Damon, William Devane, Casey Affleck and Ellen Burstyn.
Plus the voices of Bill Irwin and Josh Stewart. INTERSTELLAR is
stellar!

I respect what they were trying to do in this movie but it just doesn't
work. Rule number one of cinema don't disrespect your audience. Science
fiction is known to take a lot of liberties with the content matter but
you have to draw the line somewhere. You just can't manipulate the laws
of physics and say that it's perfectly acceptable just because it
happens to work in some hypothetical parallel universe. Also, this
movie is totally the opposite of entertaining. If you're trying to make
something that captures the viewer please make it less realistic, but
for goodness sake don't try to pass it off as something that might be
factual, feasible, and holy in your own twisted mind. It's almost as
bad as people making movies ""based on a true story"".

After watching Interstellar, do yourself a favor and get lost in space
and time and go back in time to see Contact (1997) and 2001: A Space
Odyssey (1968) to further wonder and wander into the realms of the

and brings out the best in us.

Just Amazing, one of my favorite. As an Audivisual Arts producer, I
could say that I really root for this one, I love movies, and this one
is fantastic in it history, photography, and dialogues all within a big
performance of the actors. I could say that I cry twice the first time
I saw it, and I do cry each time a see it. Beyond science fiction, the
family relationship between the characters involves you in the
story-line from the first act to the last one. I do love so much the
whole theories bout the space (I wanted to be astronaut) science is
fascinating, and with this movie you can learn some if you are
interested to. Just enjoy it PD: sorry for my bad English and grammar.

Sci-fi's have always been my favorite movies as my interest in
astrophysics and the universe in general has always been a passion of
mine starting at a very young age. But as an artist as well, it's so
much more valuable and powerful when a strong story is developed and
played out so well as in this movie. This was the Titanic of Sci-fi's
by far. To top it all off, the appreciation of logical and relative physics
(for the most part) kept me that much more interested rather than
flying off into la la land as with most sci-fi movies and their
fictional realities which some seem as obviously fake as large eyes on
anime characters are to their creators reality. Excellent story, excellent build up and finish and the music was
absolutely perfect keeping you on your toes building the intensity all
the way through which keeps you as emotionally attached to the events
as they build and unfold. I've seen this movie 4 times now and can't get enough. One of the best

formed into binary code. Cooper and Murphy follow them to a secret NASA

Do not trust the trailer! The trailer does not reveal anything about
the movie itself!After being IMDb user for 2 years, I have finally decided to invest my
time for a movie review, because Interstellar deserved it. This movie
made me shiver. This movie made me cry. This movie made me stand up and
applaud.At first, I thought it is one of those boring sci-fi movies, that i do
not like watching. However, after my classmate suggested me this film,
i gave it a chance. Now I could kiss the feet of the person who
convinced me giving it a shot. This priceless masterpiece is through
provoking, thrilling and emotional. It is also one of those films that
need to be watched 5 times to be understood from A to Z.The whole film theory is not the most important part. The emotion is
what truly matters. It is not about special effects, It is all about
the significance of the humanity.I believe this movie will help me in my future, because it gives a lot
of positive energy. I am considering to use this movie as an example in
my essays.If you like good quality movies, that are not only built on special
effects, I recommend you Interstellar - you will not leave the edge of
your seat for almost 3 hours!Ratings: Idea of the movie: 10/10 Acting: 9/10 (The actors should have been more excited at some places,
you do not see things like that everyday!) Soundtrack: 10/10 Laconicism: 9/10 (Almost 3 hours, It could be about
10-20 minutes shorter)Directing: 10/10Special Effects: 10/10Positiveness: 10/10 Emotionality: 10/10 Subject: 9/10 (As I said, I am not a great fan of sci-fi, however this
mixture of genres made a killing) Coherence: 9/10 (Some places were unclear theoretically, but that's
probably because I am too dumb to understand!) Atmosphere: 10/10Only two movies have made me cry. One of them was Forest Gump, another
one is Interstellar.

Interstellar is a film that summons all audiences in the same time and
raises questions and feelings - the movies of Nolan use on a very good
way the visual and sound tools of cinema in order to ""Feel"" the action
and not just ""see"" it. The film pushes through what he puts in place
(like the main character): the dramatic stakes, metaphysical
questions... And even if the reflection is not always accessible, it
remains, through the film, an amazing and unique science of rhythm,
which the director has the secret. A film highly cinematographic. If
you are not a ""cinema professional"", go ahead also, you will find some
beautiful and sensitive experiences during the screening of the film.
All the Nolan's thematics are inside the almost three hours of footage
: Love, Family, Perseverence, abandon, time...
"

Firstly I would just like to say, that I am no movie expert. I do not
really know what makes a movie great for other people. But for me, it's
all about how it makes you feel, and Interstellar made me feel like I
was with them on that spaceship. It made me sad, hopeful and completely
amazed. It moved me. It made me interested in the cosmos, the planets,
the stars. It made me want to know everything they did, so I could go
where they went and discover new planets. And I know that I wasn't the only one, because the whole movie theatre
was completely silent like they where holding their breath. And that's
what I think a good movie does. It can bring an entire theatre full of
people to a complete stop and make them concentrate. And hopefully
think. Because Interstellar does bring up the issue of pollution,
global warming and Earth becoming inhabitable for humans. So in
conclusion - I loved this movie. Even if all the facts weren't
completely accurate. It's a movie that, I think, everyone should see.
"
310,10,"
Many people will claim to be 'Christopher Nolan's biggest fan', so I'll
add myself to that list as a huge admirer of his work, and to the group
that can't actually believe he hasn't won an Oscar.Consequently my hopes are always sky high when it comes to his latest
movie, and when it came to Inception, while it took two views, my hopes
turned out conservative.But we're here for Interstellar. When it emerged Nolan's next picture
was to essentially turn his attention to space my trust was implicit in
him that it would be something special - and those hopes were realised,
but I will concede he has done even more special work than this.Interstellar sees McConaughy's retired naval pilot Coop trapped in a
borderline post-apocalyptic earth of the near future where dust and
blight are basically killing all crops and mankind with them. The only
way to save man is to find a new home, and Michael Caine's Professor
Brand has a plan to achieve that, but it will require Coop to abandon
his family (including beloved daughter Murph) for an indeterminate
period while the plan goes into action.So just how good is Interstellar? Plot wise it's another which requires
a couple of views to get the most out of it, and while you will feel
much more satisfied on that second viewing, there will remain questions
which come as a result of the topic - space, time travel and quantum
mechanics are astounding topics to take on in cinema, and Nolan would
never have been able to cover them all flawlessly. It's a fantastically
compelling story, which has created a massive world of intrigue within
itself - philosophical questions will abound for months, years
afterwards, and those little plot holes probably only add to that.Directorally I would concede it is not his best piece of work - some
aspects here are a little muddled and not overly clear - such a
convoluted storyline was impossible to smooth over completely - but
cinematography-wise it's by far his best. Some of the cascading views
you will see here, in conjuction with the truly staggering special
effects/CGI (the black hole and tsunamis are simply gorgeous), are
mesmerising and probably the best ever seen in cinema.It is a slight pity, in terms of plot, that while it's well known Nolan
made this his most personal and emotional film yet, the themes of love
don't truly convince in the way they're delivered. A monologue Anne
Hathaway's Brand gives reeks of Nolan's own opinion desperate to find a
place for itself in this story, and it doesn't work.But the soundtrack does - very different to Inception, and no less
epic, haunting or beautiful, even if the same riffs and melodies tend
to be reused a lot.The acting? McConaughy's muddy Texan accent still struggles to make
sense - same trouble with True Detective, but that aside it's entirely
flawless from the entire cast.And lastly the ending. Some will not be happy with it - my issue with
it was how abruptly it was delivered, and how the mild flaws in overall
direction led to it not being as coherent as it could have.Overall it is still a 10/10 - Nolan is judged in different ways to mere
mortal directors, and the only one of his films I haven't got as 10/10
is Insomnia, itself a remake. But it's the weakest of his non-Batman
movies.Still outstanding though.
"
311,9,"
I'll be the first to admit I'm not a huge fan of Christopher Nolan, I
find his movies are technically well-done but fall apart the more one
thinks of them, particularly ""Inception."" I would say that
""Interstellar"" is somewhere between the bombastic nonsense of
""Inception"" and the stellar grandiosity of the Batman series - it is
structurally similar to Nolan's other films and carries the same
heavyweight attention to special effects, but its narrative can't
sustain its ideas. That being said this is still grand cinema: There
are scenes here that are unlike anything I'd ever seen and the score is
majestic and haunting. It's unfortunate that the film becomes entirely
abstract in the last third, and ultimately dilutes some of its own
pomposity in favour of an introspective arc it didn't earn.
"

Throughout the history of produced fiction a common theme is the
conflict between humanity and technology. This conflict arises from the
idea that humanity is a pure concept capable of achieving anything
while technology is limited by the design intended by it's creator. The
normal conclusion drawn from this is that anything produced from
technology cannot be greater than humanity as humanity is not a
quantifiable element that can be reproduced.In the film Interstellar, a story is told in which a group of explorers
go to another galaxy via a wormhole to try to find a new planet to live
on as the Earth is dying. The film explores concepts such as how
Relativity actually works, Love as a measurable physical thing and
humanity within machines. While the film deals with many more issues
(many existing within the realm of the philosophical), these mentioned
ideas are prevalent throughout the whole film.The protagonists of the film leave Earth in a noble effort to try to
save all of humanity from an ecological disaster. The motivations of
these characters are unselfish and prosocial at it's most basic
element. As the story progresses the audience learns that one
character, Dr. Brand has personal reasons for going on the expedition,
that an antagonist character Dr. Mann (ironically named) has a absolute
sole motivation of achieving the mission only for the sake of it. This
includes minimizing the importance of the existence of other people
around him.We are also introduced to a couple of artificial characters. Despite
these characters being created by members of humanity they display an
authentic range of emotions. These emotions include humor, sarcasm, a
preference for caution and trust. While the humans can set the level of
each of these emotions, the artificial beings display authentic and
healthy responses. They assist the goals of the protagonists and help
keep them on course with the larger noble goals.Interstellar presents several positive themes and one of many that it
got right is that a person can be better than it's parent. It
reinforces themes that a person is in charge of their life and how they
are in control of their own life rather than just a product of their
parents.

i consider myself an average person, with an average intelligence
level.this film towards the end lost me a little.. but inception also had the
same effect on me. i think with these films they are very well put
together, i loved the visuals and the story. thats why i gave this film
a 7. maybe one day i will watch it again, understand the ending a
little better and rate it higher, but watching it for the 1st time it
won't be everybody's perfect film. still a really entertaining watch

Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" is an emotional and fascinating look
into the future of humanity, a time when Earth's resources are scarce,
corn holds the economy together, and dangerous dust clouds threaten
civilians on a day to day basis. It is clear that we cannot hold out
for much longer. ""You're daughter's generation will be the last...."" says Professor
Brand, played by Michael Caine.The daughter in question is young Murph, played at different ages by
Makenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain, and another famous actress who's name I
will not reveal. Murph's father is Cooper, played with surprising
sincerity by Matthew McConaughey, fresh off his Oscar win from ""Dallas
Buyer's Club"" and proving that Wooderson finally got over his high
school nostalgia and decided to grow up.Cooper is recruited by Professor Brand to pilot a space station to the
planet Saturn, where an alien wormhole has been detected. Three other
expeditions have already gone through the wormhole in search of other
planets that may be habitable to us. Now it's up to Cooper and his
team, among them Professor Brand's own daughter played by Anne
Hathaway, to zip across the galaxy and assess which of the three
expeditions found the best home for the future of mankind. The space adventure is completely spellbinding. From the launch off
Earth, the journey to Saturn, the trip down the wormhole, to the
unexplored worlds, and eventually into a black hole, we are given one
dazzling sequence after another, showing off the vastness and beauty of
the universe as the audience is invited not just to witness, but also
feel as though we part of the crew. The physical science piles itself
on thickly, but always assumes the audience is smart enough to know
what the characters are talking about. A weaker movie would probably
dumb the dialogue down, but ""Interstellar"" respects the intelligence of
it's audience more than the average film. Several times, we feel like
we're figuring things out along with the crew, especially in a
spectacular sequence towards the end when McConaughey discovers certain
revelations, and we are exactly one step ahead of him, sharing in the
excitement. But beyond the spectacular whimsy this film offers, it's also strongly
grounded in its themes of love, separation, abandonment, fear of time,
and hope for the future. It knows that doing the right thing is a
complex issue. Even good people usually act on self interest. When
Cooper is faced with the choice of saving the world or never seeing his
daughter again, we understand where he's coming from. ""Interstellar"" is
not the first film to send an astronaut crew into the realms of deep
space to solve some sort of earthly dilemma and encounter hostile
obstacles along the way. But it may be one of the best.

Christopher Nolan updates Stanley Kubrick with a vengeance and i wish
Arthur Clarke & he were both alive to see INTERSTELLAR! This is not to
belittle the greatness of Clarke & Kubrick, but to lament why
Christopher took half a century to do this for us, after ""2001:Space
Odyssey"" kept up our interest on the subject for 3 generations.Perhaps
Nolan was too busy exploring the quality of evil in ""Dark Knight"" and
the possibility of interjecting our dreams with it, evil, that is,in
""Inception"",or perhaps he wasn't even born when a friend of mine and i
trooped off on a Sunday morning in Delhi City,both of us about 17,to
watch HAL do his/it/IBM thing in the early 1970's!But that is all in
the past and Nolan avoids the past like the plague because he believes
we are now,in the future,in a blight which is worse than a
plague,despite having turned our artificial intelligentsia of TARS,KIPP
& CASE into friendly neighborhood explorers!And while the origins of
mankind is passé,school-book stuff if you know your Darwin,what mankind
really needs is to dust off its ambiguity,its indecisiveness,its
procrastination,its revisionist agrarianism (which is the killing cause
of dusty death on Earth)to go way boldly further than simply star
trekking or hitch-hiking on a much more serious mission to find another
planet to survive on!What makes INTERSTELLAR simply the greatest sci-fi
movie ever is that Christopher Nolan makes the search and the need for
the alternative so urgent,so immediate,so critical,so now or never that
you are at the edge of your seat for close to 3-hours and ready to fly
out at the end of the movie to go find your space craft,your space
shuttle,your space crew, your sartorial space suit, and lift off on
your mission to make sure that mankind, born on Earth doesn't end up
dying in it! In the process you discover the inward collapsing black
hole,the corridor creating cosmos connecting worm hole,the all-of-time
at one-time tesseract - what the Hindus call the 'tatra' - the
'that'(tat) - the 'there'(tatra),the book shelf with the prompting
books & the ghost behind it prompting you which is you,the watch and
not just time as a dimension but the timely dimension & the circularity
of it,the feminine principle, and the triumphant return, not as a fetus
to end some silly war on Earth but over a century younger,relatively
speaking,a deus ex machina ready to take off all over again...you
yourself , an alien an extra- terrestrial in INTERSTELLAR who discovers
that EARTH is simply an anagram of HEART, spun over and over again,by
the gravitational pull that we FEEL attraction! Eart-h-eart-h-eart-
h-earth-Heartheartheart!Earth Heart!WHERE OUR HEART IS,IS OUR EARTH!

Space. Time. Gravity. Love?This first part will be spoiler free. I'll leave a break for the
spoilers, because if you haven't seen this yet, I really recommend you
do.Interstellar is set in the near future...Earth is running out of food,
and as a planet, we've got to figure out what to do next. I'm not a
sci-fi fan. I'm not really into the fantastical, space, time travel
stuff. I like my movies a bit more grounded. However, I'm a huge fan of
Christopher Nolan and I've become a huge fan of Matthew McConaughey, so
I knew I would be seeing Interstellar.I'm glad I did.Interstellar is not without it's problems - I'll get into that in the
spoiler section - but one of the problems I felt it did NOT have was
inaccuracies in space travel. One pet peeve of mine is when someone
goes to see a movie like Interstellar and treats it as a documentary.
Yes, there are wild jumps in logic and imagination here, but that's
true of all great movies. Terminator, for example. Smartest thing
Skynet could have done to prevent John Connor from existing? NOT SEND
THE TERMINATOR. If they didn't send the Terminator, Kyle Reese wouldn't
have been sent to protect Sarah Connor, they wouldn't have gotten busy
in an old Motel 6, and John never would have existed...but without that
small gap in logic, we would have missed out on one of the great movies
of 1984.This movie will, as the kids say, make you 'feel some kind of way'.
When it ended, I sat there with my friend in awe of what we had just
seen. It presents some ideas in a way I've never seen on screen, and I
thought they were fantastic. This movie is an ode to adventure, a
throwback to older blockbuster movies about traversing new terrain.
Hans Zimmer's score is fantastic, and every actor here holds their
weight. If you haven't seen it yet, get to the theater before it's too
late. We saw it in a 'Lie-MAX' theater, so the screen wasn't official
IMAX size, but it was good enough. If you watch this at home, you're
robbing yourself of at least some of the experience. Space travel has
never looked so good.MY FINAL GRADE: B+SPOILERS. If you haven't seen the movie, don't read past this. Don't
say I didn't warn you.Some things I loved about this movie. The banter from the robots. Matt
F******G DAMON showing up halfway through as a space-crazed maniac,
hell bent on human (or possibly just his own) survival. The way
EVERYTHING looked. It looked so damn good. The girl who played a young
Murphy was fantastic. Everyone was great. The scene where McConaughey
gets back from a botched mission and sits down to see his kids grow up
in front of his eyes on a screen was just heart wrenching. The only
person that I didn't love in this movie (acting-wise) was Anne
Hathaway.Some things I didn't like about this movie. Hathaway has a speech about
love that does two things very wrong - one, it's written horribly and
delivered so awkwardly that you could tell she wasn't 100% into what
her character was saying. Two, it completely discredits her as a
scientist. It may have been one of the worst monologues I've ever
heard. The sound mixing was a bit off. Certain bits of dialogue were
very hard to hear, namely what Professor Brand says with his last
words. The setup felt rushed. One minute, McConaughey is in the secret
NASA building, and seemingly an hour later, he's packing up to leave
for a long time. Build that up a bit. Let him work it over in his mind,
build up some drama. Finally, the ending was very off, namely
McConaughey walking into a hospital room to see his daughter (who is
now older than him) and no one else in the room acknowledging him like
he's Bruce Willis in the Sixth Sense. He then proceeds to have what
looks like a 10 minute conversation with his daughter (whom he hasn't
seen in close to 100 years) and then bounces. That's it???Overall, this movie had it's issues, but those are small nitpicks. I
really liked this movie, and the experience was amazing seeing it on
the (semi) big screen.

Well what a movie this one turned out to be. It blue me out of my mind.
heheheh. In my personal opinion, you would have to have a great
extensive knowledge on Physics in particular with Space Travel. Like
Space-Time Continuum etc., I was lost there. When I saw that Hans
Zimmerman was providing the Music Score, I was saying, looks like
another Batman movie taking a trip ie seeing it a few times. By golly
did it live to its name, ie the Music. The plot was kinda difficult to
portray more so my lack of knowledge of the Physical. Earth basically
is running out of resources. So Cooper(McCounaghey) along with
TARS(Irwin-voice) - the most adorable thing. heeheh, Instantly fell in
love with him. hehehehe, Brand(Hathway). Romlliy(Gyasi), Getty(Grace).
Cooper leaves behind, Murph(Foy(10yrs), Chastain(), Burtsyn(ODLER)),
Tom(Chalamet(15yrs)Affleck()). At the beginning of the film, we see
videos. Now I suspect these were the people who either survived or
lived trough or whatever the Dust Storm back in the hey day. Cooper
heads up on the mission as recruited by Professor Brand(Brand's
Daughter(Caine)). He however as we later learn, forgot to mention One
titchey weenye thing. And that is, THEY NEVER COME BACK. There're
mission or so they understood, was to find a place to get back. While
they are on the mission, they encounter Dr. Mann(Damon). Who later
reveals to em the truth, and tries to sabotage the plan. The plan was
that they start Civilization on the new planet. And to FORGET about
Earth. Cooper was given a choise of ""You might have to decide between
seeing your children again and the future of the human race."". Another
thing, I have to mention were the VIEWS. Oh it was heaven. Looking at
Earth from the Station. I repeated several times to myself, that I can
only imagine what the iMAX will be like. Oh boi. Sadly Getty looses his
life in one of the mission goes awry.

after that they find information in to Murphy's room which was done by
gravity to give them the code to find the space center and here's some
how there is some contradictions in the following event that after the
space center offering him to go as a pilot and then there was a message
sent to tell him to stay and not to go so why he sent the message stay
after sending the message of the place of the space center he can not
send this from the beginning and may be he realized later that he
should save the earth by telling the earth by telling them how to know
the universe around thing to tell them the truth and how they can save
the planet that sounds OK ,right ?NO, because he is not affected by time he can try infinite many times
in the same second and if he didn't go at all he will just allow the
earth to end by 25 years . I wish really to understand why he made this
so if any one has any explanation please just tell me.

A nonsensical approach to wormholes,paternal love and a 40 year old
equation.....If there's one thing as limitless and ever expanding as the universe,I
believe it must be Christopher Nolan's cerebral whirlpool,but some
physicists believe that the ever expanding universe may one day
collapse in on itself...and although fortunately since that has not
occurred,I guess it might stand true for Nolan's whirlpool right
now.... Starting from some inexplicable turn of events in the plot to a
paradigm shift in Nolanesque cinema style....interstellar was a mixed
bag of sorts of which to call it Nolan's high point would be stretching
things a little too far....Gone are those days of cold,steely drama amidst high bravura and true
heroism,and this time Nolan paves way for soapy emotional drama and
really deep astrophysics(2 research papers came out of it's
movie-making!!!)...As it occurs in infinite Hollywood movies,in the beginning we are
introduced to an about-to-be-post apocalyptic world reeling under
agricultural crisis,where we meet our protagonist Cooper,an ex-NASA
pilot turned farmer who pushes each passing day fueled only by his
memory of the bygone days of exploration and 'Top Gun' macho
piloting... It's when Murph,call her prodigy or just plain
paranoid,sees coded messages in the strange events around the bookshelf
that the plot thickens like the dust from the dust cloud.Equally
strange would be how Cooper stumbles upon the NASA secret station only
to find out that he is the chosen one to lead the new batch of
explorers to far away galaxies in search of hospitable
planets...Artistic Freedom,right??Contrary to what the movie makes us believe,Cooper agrees to pilot the
ship not out out any altruistic intentions to save the doomed human
race or to save his kids even;it's clear as day that he did so only to
feel 'alive',because he could do something he was really good at... In
Breaking Bad,Walter White confesses to Skyler that he could not quit
his meth cooking,not because he wanted to leave behind a mountain of
cash for his family,nor was it the threat of tying off loose ends,it
was just for a very personal reason of feeling the 'high' of doing what
you are really good at.....Witnessing truly spectacular waves and losing an astronaut at Miller's
planet,our heroes return to Endurance only to find their fellow
astronaut aged 23 years more....that surely delivers enough to convey
Einstein's Relativity theory in a matter of few seconds...23 years of
solitude in a metallic can in a god-knows-where galaxy,surely makes him
a front runner for Arkham Asylum...It's in Dr.Mann's station that we find Jason Bour..oops..Matt Damon
finally staying away from the grid of Agency backstabber's in a
hyper-sleep chamber...only to reveal later that the idea was always for
new colonization and never to save the poor souls back on earth....
Cooper and Amelia finally part ways at event horizon(makes for a
beautiful farewell)and Cooper plunges into the dark territory that
Marty mentioned a long time ago in True Detective...only to eventually
wake up in Murph's bookshelf(or behind it,i wonder?)....As in true Nolanesque style,the events in the beginning slowly unfold
bending more than time,space,gravity sometimes even logic and
definitely more than Sloan's bullets in Wanted..With a TARS honesty parameter of 90%,it would be safe to say this isn't
Nolan's finest work...it maybe his most scientific,most soapiest,most
audacious,yes,but definitely not his best...Barring the countdown,the
giant waves,the Endurance docking,the event horizon,the wormhole travel
and to an extent Zimmer's heavy church-organ score,Interstellar even
falls short of giving us that delicate Nolan Moment....

As a HUGE fan of Christopher Nolan's previous work I was hyped and
on-board for this film from the moment it was announced. However since
this film's release last week it has gained several negative reviews
from YouTube movie critics claiming that it is overrated. Having now
seen the film I can say that this is simply not true. I think the
negative response this film has gained is down to the fact that it
could never live up to the hype, therefore the final product no matter
how good will always have been considered a disappointment. This does
not make it over-rated but rather over- hyped. The acting from all the
cast was fantastic, the characters felt real and you can genuinely
relate to them, even the young girl playing 'Murph' gave a surprisingly
convincing performance. The writing was brilliant, the characters spoke
and acted like real people and the writers excellently blended science
fiction, science fact and the theoretical. Where this film excels is
definitely in the visuals. The CGi when used looks beautiful and the
use of practical effects was a great choice. That being said the film
was by no means perfect, there was quite a lot of scenes that were
their simply for exposition (this is the same for many Christopher
Nolan films) and the space between the second act and the finale of the
film did begin to drag. The film was also very long and there were a
couple of scenes I feel should have been chopped and cut for time
reasons. Overall Interstellar was a brilliant film that is definitely
up their with Christopher Nolan's best work and is definitely one of
the best movies of 2014! A must see for sci-fi fans and film fanatics
alike. 9/10

***************SPOILER ALERT**********************************okay lets put it this way: If this wasn't a Nolan movie, it wont be
considered good enough....the thing is that much of its appreciation is
coming from people who so much anticipate that Nolan cannot go wrong
that now for them it is a MUST than Nolan cannot go wrong!...Gravity for instance was much more simpler then this movie but 'told'
well....But when it comes to Interstellar, we all know that the concept
was a tough one but common, haven't we seen it before?Towards the end it was like Deja-Vu revisited...Once the girl said 'STAY' I told to my wife then and there that this is
going to be the climax and I almost had the entire picture of the movie
in my mind at that very moment....It was Deja-Vu, and it was just 30
minutes into the movie...I did not expect Nolan's movie to be so
predictable I won't take it away from Nolan though, some of his concepts actually
matched with the scientific theories which says that whatever happens
in a Galaxy, there is a holographic mirror image of the same formed at
the surface of Black Hole, so I can 'kind of' relate to that but then
again...much more simpler movies have touched this thing much more
better way in the past....Here simply they have used a fancy time
machine with a worm hole...Good Movie, perhaps not as good as people would make it out to be...Watching Documentaries on Time Travel, Relativity, worm holes etc are a
must watch and in fact in less than 1 Hour they do a better job then
'Interstellar'!
"
322,8,"
Simply put: it's not new. I loved some ideas put into the movie,
awesome, but I feel like it just didn't live up to what I personally
expected - something new, revolutionary in the field of science fiction
creativity. While, for example, Inception (Nolan's other movie), or 2001: A Space
Odyssey, as well as Star Trek series - they were like that. Inception
made me search about its subject literally for months, and I was so
blown away by it. Interstellar didn't motivate me to Google much about
its subjects, and I feel as if Nolan was thinking he could get away
with what he was pulling out throughout the movie.Nevertheless, an enjoyable watch, I recommend it.
"
323,9,"
A wonderful, imaginative, and finally real sci-fi premise takes us on a
journey to the outer-limits of imagination. Very Imaginative yet
keeping within the realms of real science fiction as opposed to
fantasy, Interstellar may be what Sci-Fi people have been waiting for
since 2001 A Space Odyssey. Interstellar, undeniably influenced by
2001, will likely join 2001 within the pantheon of the greatest sci-fi
epics ever made.The film goes on an exciting journey though space to explore other
worlds and reaches other dimensions. This premise and story line paired
with the big budget extravaganza of wondrous visuals and state of the
art effects make for an amazing movie going experience.Attempting to connect this Sci-Fi with mass appeal as opposed to
challenging us with novelty as Kubrick did, make Interstellar fall
slightly short of that most legendary sci-fi film - 2001. For example,
the wonder and amazement of the unknown of space travel will be fused
with thriller/action sequences and characters that suddenly and
implausibly become evil bad guys, so that the awe and amazement
stemming from the unknown of space/time travel alas merge into the more
routine, ""entertaining"", unrealistic Hollywood thrill rides with its
loud music and edge of your seat, fake scenes. Fortunately those
sequences are only a small, ignorable part of the grandiose film. The wonders of space and imagination simply needed to stay within that
theme to capture the audience; instead these wonders become diminished
by implementing Hollywood drama and emotions expressed by the
astronauts chosen to embark on the mission. Feeling a bit miscast, when
seeing Ann Hathaway (who plays one of the astronauts) putting on her
singing in Les Miserable face, also Matt Damon, and even Mathew
McConaughey (despite decent acting from him), led the mesmerizing
journey into the unknowns of our universe(successfully accomplished in
2001, where its sterility from its astronauts made the actual
outer-space become more of the character), to a mood that is a bit more
ordinary and mainstream than some may hope for. I guess I personally
wished for a slightly different film, one that didn't need to dwell as
much on the human emotional world and chose to be where the setting
actually was in outer space. A film explaining a bit more about the
scientific phenomenon going on in planet earth that led to the need to
seek out habitable planets and more explanations of what is going on in
space. By the conclusion, there was a typical Nolanesque, mind bending,
brain twisting conclusion challenging the audience to decipher what
happened. The truth is the conclusion might be genius and really work
brilliantly if it is able to be correctly understood or it might be
something meant to be subject to interpretation. These tarnishes could not hold back the film from reaching and
attaining those outer-limits. Since the premise and story were
undeniably there and visually we were exposed to the imagination of the
wonders and awe of space, time and other dimensions.
"
324,8,"
To paraphrase Douglas Adams: INTERSTELLAR is big. Really big. You just
won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean,
you may think INCEPTION's a big film, but that's just peanuts to
INTERSTELLAR...Director and co-writer Christopher Nolan has taken the super-size
option with his latest epic. As planet Earth withers on the vine,
mankind needs to find somewhere else to survive - whether in this
galaxy or the next. A team, led by Matthew McConaughey, heads off into
space and a wormhole which may take them to a planet suitable enough to
sustain human life...and our race.Vast in scope, stuffed to bursting with ideas, INTERSTELLAR has
spectacle in abundance. Although even watching it in IMAX, you get this
weird feeling that you're being shortchanged. That the massive screen
is somehow cramping the film's style, that the near three hour runtime
is restricting Nolan's vision. INTERSTELLAR is the proverbial quart in
a pint pot, a movie overflowing with purpose, ambition and scale.All of which is to be naturally applauded. In an era of
lowest-denominator comedies and cookie-cutter sequels, ambitious,
original cinema is a rare commodity these days. When a film like
INTERSTELLAR comes along, it fully deserves our acknowledgement and our
cheers; it reminds us of how powerful and richly rewarding the
cinematic experience can be.Not that we should completely turn off our critical faculties. A closer
look at Nolan's epic reveals several plot points left unforgivably
fuzzy. Scientific explanations - crucial to the audience's
understanding of key parts of the story - have been clumsily shoved
into the dialogue. An extended sequence on a water-covered planet -
whilst undeniably exciting and spectacular - is completely redundant.
And don't get me started on that ending, which essentially makes most
of what has gone before completely pointless.Yet in the scale of things, these are merely nitpicks. INTERSTELLAR is
not 2001: A Space Odyssey - what films are? - but it is still a brave,
intelligent, thought-provoking addition to the cinema of science
fiction. Most importantly of all, INTERSTELLAR endorses us - the human race. It
states that as a species, we deserve our place in the cosmos, that we
have the determination to survive - no matter what the odds. A positive
message to be welcomed in these nihilistic times.
"

'Interstellar' is a WORMHOLE to traverse into a surreal and fascinating
cosmos artistically depicted by 'CHRISTOPHER NOLAN'.Viewers experience a gravitational pull emanating from the stellar
screenplay, and an outstanding thought of the GENIUS Black hole
""Christopher Nolan"".Talking about Black hole without referring STEPHEN HAWKING is like
black hole without Singularity(as he described about 'singularity') and
the same 'singularity' under which the whole movie revolves, and not to
forget Indian scientist CHANDRASEKHAR who is among those people who
explained BLACK HOLE.From the ''INCEPTION'' of the movie, Nolan's goal was to portray that,
""We have a place outside our solar system, for mankind to endure (the
reason why i think he named the spacecraft in the movie ENDURANCE) and
the quest for the same is to, why NASA spends 1 LAKH CRORE every year
on space exploration and why this movie producers spent 1100 CRORES in
the making.NASA could have shown the images taken from the Hubble telescope, at a
resolution of 1240x1748 and can you zoom it only 4 times on your
computer display. But 'Nolan' recreated the black hole (at the center
of the GALAXY (Centaurus A), 10 million light years from earth) with a
resolution of 4096×2160 and with Dolby digital surround sound inside
the theater in a completely new dimension, seems like we are traveling
on a spacecraft.Nolan achieved ''TRANSCENDENCE'' both in Visualization and Cinema
Making, Working on this film could have injected ''INSOMNIA'' in Nolan
as he had to worked tirelessly (enrolling himself in the university to
study space science: especially for this film) in creating this
masterpiece.His trademark making style started from ''FOLLOWING'' and following
which he revealed his ''BATMAN'' instincts which he ended it in style
with ''DARK KNIGHT''. He is the next superman to travel into space and
also allowing us to travel (MAN OF GALAXIES).Actually ''THE PRESTIGE'' is for Hollywood and all the movie lovers to
have him.Interstellar is a movie to be must watched.But in real, some day we all will traverse through a wormhole to find
our second earth, also to find out the secret behind the GOD PARTICLE
(with which this universe has started) to be particular, 'FINDING OUR
ORIGINS'.
"
326,8,"
I cannot remember the last time I've been this split about a movie, the
way I am with 'Interstellar'. The movie features a general plot that I
absolutely love, Earth is dying and Earth's remaining survivors must
send people in search for a new planet to save mankind. I've always
been fascinated by space and I love how Nolan explores the unknown,
such as far off galaxies, wormholes, blackholes, and gravity. The
brilliance is that he is basically free to do whatever he wants with
them since hardly anything is known about such anomalies. Time was at
the center of the movie, it was the driving force for the main
character and it was intriguing to see how time manipulated people's
motives, its a force you cannot fight and win against. But on the other
end of the spectrum, with a movie like this, you open up a door to a
plethora of questions, which happens to be the case. There are moments
where the movie just forces you to assume something with very little
explanation (especially characters motives for doing certain acts). The
movie also beats you over the head with constant talk about gravity and
relativity, as if the entire audience had a PhD in physics. That was a
huge drawback for the film, it relied so heavily on those concepts that
it was hard to follow or understand as they went from one idea to the
next with little explanation. You know when you have a real life
physicist on the set explaining such topics to you, that the audience
might be left behind scratching their heads. As for the acting
department, the movie was surprisingly tame, outside of Matthew
Mcconaughey, no one stood out, they just did their jobs and that was
the end of it. Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, and Michael Caine were
all fine, but certainly nothing to brag about. As for the ending, I
still have mixed feelings about it, I really wanted a huge 'No way!'
curveball thrown at me, but instead we got an overly explained ending
that we knew would tie into the beginning of the film. But it was sort
of bittersweet in a sense and I kind of enjoy that type of thing. But
again, not enough can be said about the general ideas Nolan wanted to
put on screen, they were ambitious and very intriguing to think about
post film. I'm glad someone took a chance on such complicated and
sought after ideas, even if they came up short (we surely will not be
seeing something of this caliber in a very long time). Best movie of
2014?........sadly no. That title belongs to 'Gone Girl' or
'Snowpiercer'Full Review at : www.simplefilmreviews.com

This movie is so eloquently presenting us with our current problems
that we have to be blind to miss the chance to change our main goals as
species...It seems that one has to eat a lot of corn to be able to produce such a
concept as Interstellar. Or am I wrong? :) This sci-fi movie is
dedicated to our eternal struggle to reach and research, to conquer and
obtain. It strives to reach for Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", but
somewhere near the end of its run it lands below it. At the end of its
169-minute runtime one feels relieved that he has endured this
emotional and transcending journey into space-time, gravity and
physics. So much information and ideas float throughout this movie that
we feel incomprehensibly lacking intelligence at some moments. That is
because Mr. Nolan is giving us too much information in too short time. That being said - the film is incredible and beautiful. And even more -
practically a direct message to our hearts that it is up to us to
decide what to do - concentrate on saving our planet and our species or
on what we do best - survive no matter what. The constellation of
actors is incredible - McConaughey, Hathaway, Caine, Damon, Chastain,
Affleck - we see almost the best cast which one director can assemble
these years. And they play very well. The viewer can feel and succumb
into their emotions - fear, despair, happiness, hope and so on. The
camera perfectly follows the circular journey of our main character
(conqueror) Coop'. The special effects and the music are GIGANTIC. Hans
Zimmer is truly offering us the feel of depth and infinity.The drought and famine which are the problem of the future's Earth are
our problem right now too. Climatic changes are bringing us to the same
problems which are presented in the movie as a certain reason of our
species demise. That is why this film is so necessary at this point of
our development as a modern society. That is why I liked very much the
way Mr. Nolan has expressed his views in this movie.Also, please keep in mind that there are some VERY emotional and
controversial scenes of confrontation between McConaughey and Hathaway,
between McConaughey and Damon. There are some peaks of emotional strain
which can offer you not only very good acting lessons, but also a
perfect dissection of our human nature. This is what I liked best in
this movie. And also - of course the topics about family relationships
and love. It is very important that we always remember and understand
that we as humans need to share with each other, to help and to
remember each other. The the only gravity which transcends beyond time
and connects us eternally is LOVE.

soooo....lots going on here. 1st, hooray for nolan for this kind of art. someone
has to carry the torch.the film plugged me way back into my former incarnation immersed in
cosmologic ontology so to speak2012, remember that? came and went, and yet we may be living in the
wake of a new cosmologic neighborhood in which physics and spacetime
behave differently.and our quantum brains and nervous system, not too mention our
ineffable and immortal psyches are processing the new ""channel"" slowly
but surely.you know, the whole 40 is the new 25 sort of thing. our physiology and
emotional IQ's not maturing as quickly? Entropy behaving differently?after all, the Mayans said it was about Time, not the end of the world
or whatever pop culture said it was all about.at any rate, mcconaughy has grown these last couple years as has brad
pitt, into men. matthew is relaying some awesome humanity here.
effortlessly, as just a dude. not a superhero, or genius. but just
someone who's paid his dues and is good at what he does and is a good
dude to boot.btw i recommend the book "" Godel meets Einstein: Time Travel in the
Godel universe.as an old friend used to say, maybe we're the martians.

This movie is in my lifetime top 5 favs, if not #1. Everything about
this film is perfection. The story, the effects, the characters, the
theory etc. What makes this film more special is that it's not just
another Hollywood sci-fi flick, but so much research and thought has
gone into the making of this film. From Christopher Nolans vision to
the consultation of all the Phd's involved including world renowned Kip
Thorne makes this the must see movie of the century! I have seen this
movie countless times, and can see it that many more. Invest in the
extended DVD, google the diagrams/map of the timeline of this film and
search for 'The Science of Interstellar' & 'Interstellar - Nolans
Odyssey' to fully appreciate the technicality and gravity of what went
into making this movie! Have your children see it to be inspired. This
movie is perfection and leaves you thinking. Simply an outstanding
piece of work on every level! If I could give any movie I've ever seen
an extra star, this would be it! Standing ovation to all those that
were in, and involved in making this film!

As a screenwriter this must have been a challenging task to accomplish.
A lot of research had to go into writing the script. Overall, I thought
they accomplished it. It kept me interested and engaged with the plot.My only suggestion would have been to show more of his daughter's
growing up and becoming who she later became. Following her progress in
solving humanities needs would have added to the plot and made it a bit
more interesting. I think it would have connected the audience to the
urgency as to why he left her and her brother behind.The cinematography and special effects were exemplary and I admire the
editors who achieved this. The acting was well.I loved and hated the characters. I found the female scientist reasons
for wanted to go on the journey a bit stupid. She still harbored
feelings for another scientist? The plot should have elaborated a
little more on her relationship with this guy so I could care like she
did. I didn't. Overall the film was entertaining and I did enjoy it.

Christopher Nolan directed this sprawling, ambitious science fiction
tale set in the near-future that stars Mathew McConaughey as a pilot
turned farmer named Cooper, forced into that life when famine and
blight ravage the earth, forcing humankind to turn away from
exploration, even concocting revisionist history that gets his daughter
Murphy in trouble at school, but soon their lives will be dramatically
altered when he is recruited in a top secret mission headed by Dr.
Brand(played by Michael Caine) which will see him team up with Brand's
daughter(played by Anne Hathaway) on a dangerous mission into a
wormhole that just may save the human race, if they make it back in
time...Big ideas at work here, and Nolan's direction is superb, as are the
performances, though this story doesn't seem to know when to quit, and
becomes far-fetched at the climax, but still remains an impressive film
nonetheless. Will require multiple viewings.

Though I am a 'Christopher Nolan' fan, this movie has had a sobering
effect on me. While some of his earlier films were amazing (to say the
least), this film, though partly original in its storyline, isn't up to
his usual standards. However, I would still rate it above some of the
other films I have seen this past year, which makes it decent enough to
watch once and hence the 'high' rating.The film is primarily about the future of the human race in a
post-apocalyptic world where the survivors struggle for the basic
necessities required for life with the recurring poem ""Do not go gently
into that good night"" by Dylan Thomas aptly describing this struggle
for survival throughout the film. Governments soon realize that human
life on earth is no longer tenable and that they need to relocate to
some other planet if they are to survive. Within this larger context,
is a poignant story of a father who has to leave his daughter and set
out into the unknown to ensure the continuance of the human race, much
like the explorers of old who crossed vast oceans to discover new
lands.The science behind the film is depicted and explained as best as can be
expected with Hans Zimmer's church organ themed music setting up the
tempo for some brilliant cinematographic sequences. Musical scores like
'No time for Caution' were one of the highlights of this film. Acting
wise, the film showcases power performances from Matthew McConaughey,
Micheal Caine and Jessica Chastain though Anne Hathaway's performance
couldn't live up to her billing. Screenplay was mostly good, with the
robot 'TARS' providing sufficient comic relief to the serious themed
movie.The film falters towards the end as it drags on and on becoming more
and more gooey and mushy in an effort to have a happy ending. This is
also where the film diverges from what is scientifically probable and
enters the realm of fantasy which was disappointing. Probably, a more
realistic end to the movie would have fetched it a higher score.However, upon reflection the film does pose some interesting questions.
For example, are today's aliens future highly evolved versions of
ourselves? And if I risk it a bit more, are these extra-dimensional
beings our God(s) in the present? Who knows.

I really do not see where all the fuzz with Interstellar comes from. I
don't doubt, that it was a good movie and the visuals, as well as the
physical ideas behind the plot were amazing. The plot itself was
completely mediocre I think. It was a typical America saves the world
story, where the characters were left as undeveloped as possible. Each
and every single character was flat and I did not feel very touched by
any of their stories. I think the physical theories behind the frame of
the plot were used to much as a structure where the drama was hung up
on. All in all I do not think that this is an extraordinary movie. It
was entertaining and the physics behind it was fascinating, the story
of the characters was flat and boring though.

I got into the habit of reading lots of IMDb reviews before picking
movies, and got some mixed feelings after the last IMDb grade fiasco of
Gravity (omg omg, that one was just soooo crap). So, after seeing the
comments on this one, some very positive, some not so much, I went to
see it and was very pleasantly surprised. It may not be the grand
masterpiece some say it is, but it is a great movie, and it made me
leave the cinema pondering, which happens rarely. It has everything you
(or I at least) might want, very well put together, and interestingly I
found the story better than the visuals, contrary to some other
opinions. Well worth seeing it IMHO. For many reasons.
"
336,7,"
I had high expectations for this film and i did enjoy it, however i
also left the cinema feeling a bit disappointed. I thought it looked
beautiful, had an interesting setup in terms of the situations of the
people, both on earth and in space. BUT and it's a big but for me, i
think it was too long, badly paced and by the end i couldn't help
thinking it had all got a bit too carried away with it's own far
fetched theories. I don't mind going along with it, even if it's all a
bit of fantasy but when this film tries so hard to stick to what is
theoretically possible i think it does a terrible job of bringing that
to a realistic presentation. By the end i'd given up caring about the
characters as i felt a bit ripped off by the last 20 minutes.I would have liked more action on the planets surfaces and a bit less
of the waffle in the space ship or at least less waffle and more
action. I like Mr Nolan and i loved Inception but for me this wasn't as
good as that.
"

This film was one of the few films I've actually felt emotion to. I
cried and felt great sorrow for the loss experienced by each character
as they felt realistic and well portrayed. This review is definitely
spoiler free, but it does touch on the plot just a little, which if you
want to go in blindly without knowing anything, please stop here.It deals with the death of our planet and the survival of humanity and
the loss of time, an immutable aspect of life. There are some very high
level theoretical sciences discussed in the film but it isn't too
complex that a viewer feels like they can't understand the concepts at
work here. One instance is wormholes, which are explored fairly early
on in the film, but is explained in a way that a viewer understands the
concept, without having to understand how the phenomenon occurs.It was cinematically a masterpiece in every way, acting worth an Oscar
for everyone. Matthew, has come into his own as a brilliant actor ever
since Mud. Anne has shown us a beautiful side of her talent. Even the
less well known actors in this film have stunned me with their
performance.I can't put into words just how good of a film this is. It is worth
seeing this film in theaters by far. Talking too much about the plot
really will give away too much of what this film deals with, so
definitely if you are considering on seeing this film, see it without
reading too much. You will be surprised and astonished.Do note, this film is 2 hours and 46 minutes so be prepared.

*** Spoilers ***I used to be able to predict the IMDb rating of a moving with a
variance of +- 0.3 I would therefore rate this movie 6.8 (my own
opinion is a little lower). But the movie is rated around 9. Why is
this? Maybe I lost touch, but investigating all the flaming reviews
here, I think that Interstellar is another movie that bought reviews,
just like Godzilla (which was worse than Interstallar). Godzillas
ratings came down to 6.7 from 9. something BTW. Taking all the fake
reviews into account, it is probably a 5. something movie.Interstellar is better but still disappointing. There are a number of
references to ""Space Odissey"" (the music for example) which is
bumptious, because Interstellar has absolutely no depth with the
exception of the scene where it is revealed that children learn in
school that the moon landing was fake. This was a funny lesson about
""truth"" and really the only scene that mad it worthwhile to think
about, while for the rest it is best to set the brain to standby.
People hover at the edge of black stars and play ghosts in their own
past here, what more can I say. Why not have 4D fairies or people that
fly into the sun with only some sunscreen.

Nolan played with time before, in 'Memento', the film itself worked
like an implied wormhole, piggybacking on which a psychological
dependency was revealed. It was personal, but 'Interstellar', behind
all those saving-the-humanity clichés, is a more absolute and conscious
personal journey of Cooper. Earth's natural resources have come to the
brink. Everybody is emphasizing on an agrarian society in spite of
knowing very well that it won't do any good in the long run. Thus come
the 'Brand'ed ultimatum of ""leaving rather than saving"" planet earth.While watching the movie the confusion started in the very beginning
when the falling of dust was delivering binary codes for NASA's
location. And the entire film is based on this little creepy ghostly
event. Both me and my friend (as we have developed a skill of real-
time anticipation while watching a movie) were quite reluctant to go
with the film as everything started with a whodunit confusion, but it
was a Nolan, enough to trust, so we sat back. Now, everybody knows
about worm hole, black hole etc, thanks to Nat Geo and Discovery
Science, but it's not what we know, but what we make out. Before giving
anything out, I want to say this is a completely personal understanding
uncontaminated by other explanations, some would agree some would not.
""What's Them ?"" Clearly Nolan avoided the concept of multi-verse or
parallel universes as that is much more complicated and would create
temporal duplications like Spock meeting Spock in Star Trek which won't
go with the tempo. Another proof is ""them"". Near the end of the film we
see Cooper saying ""It's us..."" that gives away everything that we
misinterpreted from the beginning, we thought ""they"" are
""interdimensional beings"" trying to help us, aliens to be drastic. But
they were not. They were future us, trying to save their own asses by
helping their past because if we die now, they will cease to exist.
Much like ""Back to the Future"". And they are advanced enough to create
a wormhole near Saturn to give us opportunity to travel ""further"" (the
quote is intentional).The time slow-down and p-branes and strings and gravity. The time slow
down is quite understandable due to numerous popular science articles
on this subject. If you move faster relative to something your watch
will go tick to tock at a slower rate with respect to that. So will
grow old slower to that. That has been exploited ingeniously in the
film that it actually makes time an essential fuel for the journey.
Where inevitable crisis arises to choose from two options of returning
home or mission completion. M-theory has a dream of unifying all the
four fundamental forces of nature,including gravity, which is the
spookiest. After quantization, string theory there is a new unification
approach coming out in theoretical physics which depicts universe as
multidimensional membrane. Now all other forces except gravity have
gauge bosons to carry the forces out like electromagnetic force has
photons, strong nuclear force has gluons, weak nuclear force has W
bosons, gravity too has a force carrying graviton which has special
ability to travel through all p-dimensions (btw in string theory there
are possibly 26 dimensions including 3 spatial and 1 temporal). And
that is why gravity is the weakest among these four forces. And that is
why Cooper was able to communicate with Murph, his daughter from the
inside of the black hole through tweaking of gravitational waves (or
something like that). ""the Further"".We had seen it before in the ""further"" in Insidious chapter 2. Just
like in the black hole Gargantua where where time had stopped literally
because infinite curvature space-time fabric, yeah fabric, tweaking
which would make Cooper able to send message through time with the help
of gravitational anomaly, or gravitons or gravitational waves or
whatever. Now the question is how did Cooper (survive the
spaghettification due to gravity?) come out of the Gargantua? well,
maybe the Black Hole is an unknown angel, everybody fears it because
nobody has gone into it. Maybe it was actually acting as another
wormhole to spit Cooper out at last, 80 years later, after which his
age was 124 earth-years.And finally the Quantum data and the Brand equation.Escape velocity.
Evacuating earth required a huge spaceship which would carry this
massive number of passengers (even a smaller number at a time would
need a very big capacity) to somewhere else in space. And that space
ship would need a thrust power never to be achieved. It needed
something which only the quantum data beyond the cosmic censorship
could provide. To solve the the Brand equation which Brand himself
""solved"" as an impossible thing to evacuate earth, maybe TARS' data
from the metric of Gargantua provided the key ingredient. The same
principle of rotating black hole namely the Schwarzschild metric along
with the acquired data from the black hole must have been used to build
the Cooper station and sustaining human civilization by mimicking
gravity with centrifugal force. Hmmm....it's like creating a film with
a hundred times the ambiguity that Nolan left for us at the end of
""Inception"", I was actually thinking of inception by seeing the ground
being rolled up at the Cooper station at the end of the film...... Well
when you expect a science fiction from a man who created ""The
Prestige"", or ""The Memento"", or ""Inception"" you do expect something
""next gen"" right? Well it was deep, and mesmerizing with another Hans
Zimmer masterpiece.... ""Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age
should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of
the light. ""

Interstellar is the reason why I go to the theater. For years now I
have avoided most movies for they don't captivate me, they don't allow
me to forget who I am, where I am.Nolan's piece has made me enjoy every moment of that movie. I looked at
my watch few times to make sure that time would not pass too quickly,
it's about 170 minutes, and its barely enough.It's undeniable, the photography, the soundtrack, the sound effects,
the mind-bending moments, the exposure to unusual concepts, the
intensity, the beautifully orchestrated silence, the alternative
reality of Nolan's Interstellar is something that we unfortunately, or
fortunately, do not find too often in a movie.It did what most cannot do, it brings moments of intensity, of
interrogations, of discomfort, of frustration, of love, of hate, of
impatience; the spectrum of emotions is broad and solid. Despite this, I have one major issue with the movie. While I give it a
9, because I compare it to most movies, to what we have as a reference,
I am not entirely satisfied, because this movie is very close to being
a masterpiece, a piece so nicely assembled that it could go through
time and captivate people for years to come. Nolan, or the production,
who knows, have only delivered one part of the movie, the scenario, the
photography, and logic of the movie is great and hard to challenge, but
the quality of dialogues, especially between McConaughey's daughter and
him later in the movie, as well as the general interactions of multiple
characters, are weak, too weak for the quality of the movie. That is
very frustrating, not enough to make it a bad movie, but enough to make
it frustrating, for most of the job was done, most of the quality was
delivered, and here is ceases. Nevertheless, great movie, great actors,
great scenario, amazing photography, exceptional mise-en-scene, this
movie will add itself to a great list of classics.Absorbing to say the least, when I left the room and opened the door, I
realized I was here, on Earth, in a building, in this city, and that
somehow, was disappointing, because for over two hours, I was in there,
in this movie, it all was possible.

'Interstellar'  8.5 out of 10 (give or take a point) Christopher Nolan's latest work is so unlike anything else I've seen
(at least in recent years) that I think it may need to be rated in its
own little sphere of existence, outside of the rest of the cinematic
universe. The thing about 'Interstellar' is this: While it is, undoubtedly, a
masterpiece I'm not sure how to put my feelings about it into words.
It's now five days since I saw it and I'm not sure if I like it or love
it. I know I don't hate it. Given the deafening silence with which the
closing credits were met with in the cinema, I think that confusion is
a pretty standard response.To put it simply, if you don't like movies that make you think, give
this one a miss. If, like me, you enjoy a piece of cinematic art that
has you pondering everything from the origins of the universe, to your
own place in it, to the future of humankind, to the possibilities of
space travel, you must see this. At least once.Nolan, the man responsible for such visionary films as 'Inception',
'Memento', 'The Prestige' and 'The Dark Knight' trilogy has, no doubt,
delivered his greatest mind shag to date with 'Interstellar'. It takes
place in the near future where the Earth is, for lack of a better
description, dying. The surviving remnants of the human race have all
but given up on scientific and exploratory pursuits, for the simpler
task of farming. World leaders have posted their entire hopes of
survival on producing crops, an increasingly difficult pursuit due to
the 'blight' which is gripping the planet.Matthew McConaughey plays 'Cooper' a single father and former NASA
pilot, engineer, and man of science, now devoted to cultivating corn.
When he stumbles across the opportunity to pilot a space craft into
deep space, in order to explore potentially habitable planets, he is
forced to choose whether to attempt to save the human race at the
expense of perhaps never seeing his children again. His relationship
with his kids, in particular his daughter (a fellow lover of science
and explorer at heart), is the axle on which the entire film spins. McConughey is good in this, as is the rest of the cast, most notably
Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine. But, there is no doubt that the real
stars are the special effects team and the sound department. This is an
assault on the senses. The visuals of space are the best I've seen. The other thing I really like is that the science of space travel in
this movie is authentic. I'm no physicist, but this is the type of film
that has you reading up on the ideas it conjures, if you're so
inclined. Nolan actually brought a theoretical physicist on board to
ensure that the concepts used are both plausible and accurate. Black
holes, space-time, worm holes. They're all here and they're all used in
a fashion which does not leave the audience calling bullshit. Again, if
such things interest you, get on board. If not, steer clear.Writing this review has helped convince me that I do rate
'Interstellar' highly. Just how highly may depend on subsequent
viewings. It is most definitely, however, a cinematic masterpiece. It
is also, definitely, not for everyone.See more at www.facebook.com/shenaniganmoviereviews

Interstellar THE BEST MOVIE, I've ever seen in a cinema, it's simply
incredible and I need to get into this amazing universe a few more
times. This movie is everything that a movie should be, It's fast
paced, entertaining,emotional,AMAZING,this film has it all. Nolan did a
great job, the cinematography is very good, the images of our solar
system, of a black hole and of the universe are simply unbelievable.
This movie reminds me of 2001: A Space Odyssey, The looks are similar
and also very innovative.The pace is faster and The caracthers are more
sentimental,this film is the 2001 of our time. Nolan does what he does
best, he plays tricks with our minds, near to the end you will be
fascinated with what happened( It's like Inception, Memento,The
Prestige...) The actors were very good , since Matthew Mc (who did a
phenomenal job), my congrats to him, he was amazing, his caracther was
very interesting, and when he cried, IT WAS HEART-BREAKING. Anne, Matt
damson(etc), were awesome, even TARS was freaking good. Besides all the
emotional parts, the great looking and the best journey I've ever
experienced this movie has a fantastic message: LOVE IS BEYOND SPACE
AND TIME, LOVE GETS THROUGH Everything. Amazing film, maybe Nolan's
best. 9,3/10

its an 8 vote only because a) i have to see it again to really work
through some of the conundrums & b) the occasional clunky winch
inducing dialogue & c) the abuse of the 'go gently into the good night'
quote. but i fully expect to up my rating on 2nd viewing. cunning
fellow this nolan lad, gets you to pay up two times, or even twice.....
it HAS to be seen on an IMAX screen (makes me want/need to be a
millionaire)to fully experience the stunning visuals. i'd like to see a
making of some day to appreciate how much of the effects were in-
camera. back in the early 80's i saw 2001 space odyssey for the first
time in a cinerama cinema. this was equally as emotional....life
is....not bad. 2 love stories as well, 3 if you count the vote for
general humanity. & a new star in the making, a Hollywood one, the kid

I have heard of Quantum Physics theory and other related theories that
have tried to explain the unknown based on our mind limitations and the
mixture of science and believes. Interstellar has left me unable to
decide if the NASA knows facts it has not yet made public yet it has
emitted many questions within me concerning that aspect of personality
variable where one stands between having an internal or external degree
of control locus. Locus of control is the degree to which a person
believes he controls his own fate and well, Interstellar has shown
deeply how fate is predetermined, believing our choices are already
drawn up there in a similar world where time is so much different from
that we comprehend. Time is relative, and so is the truth. Interstellar
is a magnificent big screen work. Amazing direction by the amazing
Christopher Nolan. A great performance by one of my favorite of all
times Matthew McConaughey.
"
345,9,"
Flawed and as pointed out, at times it's intellectual reach exceeds its
grasp. But Nolan is probably one of the very few film-makers with
audacity and talent to go beyond the usual summer blockbuster, and
create his own universe. While 2001(Kubrick) went heavy-meta on the
universe, Nolan even when traversing the universe, keeps it about a
father-daughter, and McConaughey and Jessica Chastin do not disappoint.
Don't bother about the reviews, this is a ride across the universe you
have to take at least once. Take a bow Nolan, probably the best
storyteller of this generation. Kudos as even when creating mass
blockbusters, Nolan is not afraid to challenge the audience and
continues to push boundaries. In a movie about wormholes and the galaxy
beyond, who'd expect the most powerful scene (semi-spoiler) will go to
Jessica Chastin and a watch ticking
"
346,9,"
Interstellar fell short of a 10 because the voices in some parts were
too low, I simply could not hear what they were saying. In fact, we
missed at least half of Professor Brand's (Caine) dying confession.
Fortunately Murph (a brilliant Chastain) filled in most of those
blanks. My other issue was with the scenes around the black hole and
Cooper (McConaughey) awakening at the hospital. Those scenes were
unnecessarily complicated and it was compounded by more muffled
dialogue. Most of the movie addressed the science - factual and
fictional - in a more understandable way and spread the harder concepts
out. I loved everything else. All the actors stepped up. Standing with
Jessica Chastain and Michael Caine were Matthew McConaughey, Ann
Hathaway, John Lithgow, Matt Damon and Mackenzie Foy as young Murph.
Matthew McConaughey is no longer just a hot guy doing his thing, he is
a dad struggling to give his children a life and a future. He doesn't
always make the right decisions but he's doing the best he can.
Fortunately he has his weathered father-in-law (Lithgow) to raise his
children while he goes off to save the world. Foy masterfully captures
the emotions of the young daughter who so completely loves her dad and
feels utterly betrayed by his decision to leave. Early on Brand
(Hathaway) breaks down and I resented the 'hysterically emotional
woman' implications of that. When I stepped back, though, I realized
that unlike Cooper her whole life has been about the success of this
one mission. She abruptly learns that a lifetime of planning and a
lifetime of personal sacrifices does not guarantee success. Dr Mann
(Damon) faces similar realities but allows it to blacken his heart.
Damon perfectly plays the obsessed man. Interstellar is a thrill ride
that I hope to go on again and again.
"
347,8,"
Christopher Nolan has a reputation of psychologically deep, convoluted,
and complex thrillers (ie., Inception, Memento, etc.), and Interstellar
is no exception.Interstellar takes place in a dystopian future in which
the human race has lost the majority of it's resources and must rely on
farming for food.As the Earth is slowly dying and the human race is
coming to an end, a group of people set out through a wormhole to find
a new planet for humans to live on. To say anymore than that would be a
spoiler and it is best to go into this movie knowing as little as
possible. Interstellar is a movie that gradually changes in tone and
style as it goes on. The first act is very intriguing and leaves you
interested in finding out where the movie is going. It does a good job
establishing the dystopia and what it is like for the people on earth.
There is also an underlying theme of human drama mostly between a
father and his children. The second act takes a drastic turn and
becomes a sci-fi adventure with an abstract feel to it. There is
suspense, thrills, great visuals and special effects, and an overall
very good story that sucks you in. The third and final act of the movie
takes an unexpected twist and is one of the most interesting and
original things I have ever seen in a movie. Interstellar has a very
strong cast; there are great performances from Matthew Mcconaughey,
Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and the rest of the cast as well. There
is also a great use of music that helps to build the tension.
Interstellar is not perfect; the main flaw being that it is slightly
too long. I found the second act and part of the third act to drag on
and become too drawn out. I also felt that there were too many story
elements happening at once and it became overly bloated at times rather
than sticking to the story I was interested in. In conclusion, although
slightly too long and bloated, Interstellar is a great psychological
thriller that will leave you thinking about it long after the credits
roll. I look forward to seeing it again.
"

Nolan has come a long way since the days of Batman for he has now
transcended to becoming one of the most important directors of today's
generation. Ever since Inception, I always dreamt of Christopher Nolan
daring to aim higher, to go where few directors have succeeded, to
explore ideas that are beyond epic in scope. And now he brings to us
his perfect creation: Interstellar. It is a film that isn't just a
visual extravaganza but also asks the inevitable big question of
travelling beyond our own planet and solar system to expand the canvas
of your own existence with real science but also being supported by
this strong emotional human story.Interstellar begins in a point in a time from now where the world is
more concerned with trying to keep on existing on our planet then
trying to make new discoveries to leave it. Current issues like climate
change and world hunger are the major risks that humans face in this
difficult future. But when a wormhole appears near Saturn, it seems
humanity prays for salvation have been answered by powerful
otherworldly beings. Nolan does not show this future Earth as being a
hi-tech one like so many movies have done nor looking apocalyptic but
yet still feels by acknowledging the major issues it faces. This is a
world that has ceased moving forward technologically in order to focus
more time and resources to preserve the last agricultural crop (corn)
for food. There is even a very interesting nod to the Apollo moon
landing conspiracy that sneaks its way in.Nolan has a great eye for detail but in a very practical. Once our cast
of explorers reach into space, you sense the awe and suspense, as the
scenes in outer space feel so real and haunting while on the alien
planets leave you with beauty and wonder as Chistropher Nolan prefers
to shoot on real locations like Iceland rather then a green-screen set.
Another good note are the two robots CASE and TARS who are essentially
mobile rectangles with the latter surprisingly becomes the film's
sarcastic comic relief.The real heart of this story is the relationship between Matthew
McConaughey's Cooper and his daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy and Jessica
Chastain). As the film's theme is about us as a species abandoning our
home to find a new one in the great unknown, it asks the more personal
question about leaving behind the things we love the most like family.
As Cooper most go on this mission ensure his daughter's future but
while at the same time meaning he has to leave her behind, he is unsure
when or even if he will ever return. McConaughey brings a very serious,
emotional and dramatic performance for Cooper. Mackenzie Foy will
definitely become one of latest rising young actresses. Chastain also
bring a very intelligent and emotional performance to the adult version
of Murphy. Other great performances go to Michael Caine and Anne
Hathaway.This I would not only say this to be the best movie of this year but
also one of the important movies ever made. It questions the purpose of
existence by asking what will we start new but also what will leave
behind. Will we sacrifice what we have left to continue our future?
Will we the leave the safety of our home to explore the mysterious of
universe? Is our destiny tied to a greater purpose? Should we think as
individual by letting our emotions guides us or do we make sacrifices
to help the greater good? Nolan has crafted a masterpiece that will be
remembered for a long time.

***Spoiler Alert For Whoever Hasn't Watched The Movie*** The movie was
outstanding and original. Like other Nolan movies, this had this dark
climatic tone. The part that gets me all the time is the 4-Dimensional
beings and the whole tesseract that they made. It's a very unusual
concept but in terms of science it made sense. Love the tone, loved the
music that went with it, and I loved how in the end, he finally saw his
daughter again.. (In an unexpected way)Thumbs up to everyone who made
that movie possible. Another small problem with it though is how did he
travel back into time? He traveled back into time through the black
hole and then reappeared in the future. Just some minor
misunderstandings with the story. (I'm no science genius)

I realize I'm a little late to be posting a review of this film, but
now that I finally got around to seeing it, I feel like I need to. Nolan did a great job directing it. He knew when to make the shots
close and shaky, and when to make them wide and majestic. This unlike
another movie that takes place in space that is comprised almost
entirely of close and shaky shots, (ahem, Gravity, we're looking at
you). One particularly spectacular shot was the one on the water planet
when the crew finally realizes that the mountains they see aren't
really mountains, but are waves. The suspense in that scene was
intense, and this was helped by the huge shot of the wave as it grew
closer. The camera slowly moving up as the viewer grasps the sheer
enormity of the challenge that the astronauts are facing. A more
chaotic shot was when cooper falls into the black hole. The confusion
and intrigue created by this scene kept me on the edge of my seat.The acting was quite spectacular as well, no surprise considering the
movie's all star cast. Especially Matthew Mcconauhgey. It was clear
that he was very torn by the decision that he had to make. He projected
his emotions very well. The plot was very well developed and kept me thinking for days after
watching the film. However, creative as it was, it was mildly
depressing. Cooper wakes up from saving the world, to find that his son
is dead, (he never said goodbye), and his daughter is an old woman on
her deathbed.This was a very well done film. That said, I probably won't watch it
again. It is the story of a man who saves earth, but misses the lives
of his children. I cannot fault the stellar filmaking and special
effects, but the story of the movie itself is quite bittersweet.

This movie was utterly mind blowing. Everything was perfect. The
acting, directing, score, editing. It had just the right of everything
that makes a great movie. Facts, sincerity, intrigue, etc. Nolan took
something that is seemingly impossible to do and pulled if off
flawlessly (again). What started out as an already amazing concept was
turned into a cinematic masterpiece. The simple scope of it all is
enough to boggle minds, but then to ground it in reality and make it
understandable is the true magic.Almost 3 hours, and worth every second. This is, hands down, the best
movie Christopher Nolan has ever made, and the best Sci-Fi movie, I
have ever seen, and my ever see.

It was so engaging and so entertaining that I was sad when the movie
ended! The story is just incredibly absorbing and really satisfying!
The plot and the entire movie has such a wonderful complexity to it and
it is so beautifully layered. I actually want to see it again because
there were a few parts I'm not 100% sure I understood completely. There
are some really intense moments, as well as emotional ones. I quite
enjoyed the science being so well integrated into film. It's seamless
and it's really refreshing that the plot doesn't have huge scientific
holes in it and doesn't stretch too far away from what's possible and
what can/could potentially be possible with the unknown aspects of our
universe. The acting was excellent. Mathew McConaughey continues to
impress me. He has grown so much as an actor and he did a great job
with his role in this movie. I loved the movie and it's safe to say
many others in the theatre did too judging from all the clapping at the
end of the movie!

Interstellar is one of those films that makes you wonder about things
that happen outside of planet earth. The performances from this film are brilliant. I enjoyed seeing Michael
Caine since I've seen him in several other work by Christopher Nolan.
One thing I really like is paying close attention to familiar faces and
think about their characters in different roles they played - even if
it's only a small role, just like Michael Caine that played Professor
Brand in Interstellar.Other than that, the soundtracks composed by Hans Zimmer are very well
incorporated within the scenes, especially Cornfield Chase - it's as if
the scene touches your soul when the soundtrack starts playing. The
soundtracks itself are love at first listen.As previously mentioned, Interstellar really makes you reflect. When
watching the film I instantly thought of Gravity (2013) by Alfonso
Cuarón. Films like Gravity and Interstellar make me wonder about things
regarding to science and philosophy.

""Blown away."" These are the words I use when people ask me how I
reacted to the film. Incredible performances. We can truly feel the
bond between Murphy and Cooper, which is incredibly important because
without this relation, the movie would have no sense. It is all
scientifically accurate and is smart, intense and incredibly emotional.
The only downside to the movie is that there was no significant
development in the relation of the astronauts sent. I just didn't care
much when some of them died because there was no bond, no real
significance, although its forgivable since the movie is already 3
hours long. An yes, its a big movie: But I loved every minute and wish
it was even longer. I could watch this movie for DAYS, on repeat. I'll
stop writing this review right now, because I just want to go to the
theater again and watch this.P.S: The imperfect lock scene was THE BEST SCENE I HAVE EVER SEEN.
THANKS HANS ZIMMER THANKS NOLAN!

One of the biggest directors today is back for another original film.
After spending about years doing his Batman films he wanted to go back
to some different genres. While I must admit this is not Nolan's best
work, it certainly is still a fabulous film overall. This film is
intense. That is the best word to describe what Christopher Nolan has
done with this film. The following is my review of Interstellar.The film was written by Christopher Nolan(also director) and his
brother Jonathan Nolan. Jonathan and his brother have worked together
on most of Christopher's movie. While Christopher gets all the
attention for the most part, Jonathan is one of the better writers out
there today. I will not be spoiling the plot and will tread lightly on
what I say about the plot because it is so important to see this film
fresh. The Earth is falling apart and needs more resources. So, now
comes the group of explorers who have to find a way to save us. Their
mission is to go explore a warmhole and what it can do to save us. I
really don't want to say much more as I already feel I said too much
even though this is the basic description. The film is complex in
nature, and many will have questions as they are leaving the theater.
Repeating viewings at some point will be needed to fully understand.
This gets everyone in the theater to think, which is what the Nolans
want us to do. The story is deep in nature and asks important
questions. With some good twists and turns in the film it is sure to
leave most of us satisfied. The film does have faults. With a run time
of nearly three hours, the film can drag in spots. It never hurts the
film badly, but at one point in the film, I asked myself whether or not
they needed to explain so much and thus dragging the film too long. The
point of the film I'm speaking of is the ending. Overall, the Nolan
Brothers deliver one heck of a Sci-Fi film that will leave us with many
questions, but it also leaves us with more respect for what is next in
space travel and the process that goes into it.Christopher Nolan directed this film as well. Nolan is use to
delivering huge films that make the viewer fall into it. His films are
always visually stunning and the same can easily be said here. Nolan
takes a more practical approach to filming his movies instead of
overusing CG, however in a film like this, much more CG is needed.
Though it doesn't feel the CG was overused. His love for IMAX is
another key aspect. Nolan has been directing films with the IMAX camera
for many years now, and this might have the most IMAX footage with more
than a hour of IMAX footage. These IMAX scenes are truly something to
behold and you easily get lost in them. The visuals and his work behind
the screen are fabulous, but acting is also a key factor and Nolan
usually gets amazing work from his actors. Matthew McConaughey leads
the film which also stars Anne Hathaway. There are some very emotional
scenes in this film and McConaughey and the rest of the fabulous cast
delivers those scenes amazingly. The entire cast works under Nolan's
wing to their highest regard. This may in fact be the most well acted
Nolan film yet, which is saying a great deal. With fabulous directing
with many killer shots, and the outstanding acting, Nolan delivers
another great effort on this film.The film was scored by a Christopher Nolan regular, Hans Zimmer. Zimmer
is easily one of the best composers out there today. His scores are
bombastic and add a great deal of much needed depth. The same can
easily be said here. After listening to so many of Zimmer's scores, you
often wonder if he will make a bad score that disappoints. I was
somewhat worried about this aspect going into the film, but after
leaving the film I walked away thinking his score was another
masterpiece. In the more intense scenes the film offers, Zimmer's score
transcends what anyone could have thought he was capable of. Those who
love a great score like I do should leave the theater wanting to listen
to it all one again. This is easily one of the best scores of 2014, and
another fantastic addition to the career of Hans Zimmer.In closing, the film is not the best Christopher Nolan film. While I
personally believe all of Nolan's movies are at least very good, this
film falls somewhere in the Insomnia range. Not pure greatness, but
certainly not bad or even average. Fans who want an immersive
experience with the stunning IMAX shots and a good story, this is a
must see for you. While there are some down spots in the film, they
never bog the film down enough to truly hurt it to a point where it
makes a film barely above average. This film is truly a must see, with
so many aspects to enjoy.I went to an IMAX showing of this film, so I will talk about that as
well. When Christopher Nolan directs a film, more recently it tends to
be all out on the IMAX. Nolan is one of the few directors who actually
enjoys shooting with the IMAX camera. The best way to watch this film
is on an IMAX screen. Digital IMAX is what most locations have(and the
one I watched this film on), and while it's not the same as a real IMAX
screen, the depth it adds in not only picture quality, but sound is
untouchable by versions below it. The extra price for IMAX can be a
good bit more, but it is well worth the extra price, that is for sure.8/10
"

So Christopher Nolan has this reputation for creating films that are so
heavily looked into (except the Dark Knight trilogy), and for some
reason this film was always heading for a backlash from the Science
geeks.Gravity suffered the same fate, instead of admiring it's beauty and
great storytelling, you have this group that feels they need to slam
whether it could actually happen or not... Why?What happened to the days of just enjoying a film!?This is exactly what you should do with Interstellar, OK OK it explores
wormholes and space, but so what... let's live in this world for the
near 3hrs it runs and enjoy what it gives us, stop over thinking it,
it's the last thing you need to be doing when the story is as complexed
as it already is.The film is stunning first and foremost. C.N has really taken us back
with his use of models and backdrops instead of heavy CGI, and although
at times I noticed how it wasn't as perfect and seamless as CGI
could've been, I'm happy knowing that I can watch this in a few years
time and still get the same feeling I had first viewing, instead of
these heavily used CGI films that already look old 2 hours later...The acting is good as always in a Nolan film, and was pleasantly
surprised to see an appearance by an uncredited actor/actress, and not
for just a few minutes neither. Kudos C.N.I can't really explain too much about the story other than in simple
terms the plot is: Earth is dying, and scientists/NASA believe they
have found a few planets in another solar system capable of having
human life, that need to be explored to see if we (humans) can start
again before human extinction on Earth. Nolan does his thing with this and as long as you live in his world and
believe that the world could exist, you will have no problems going
along with the time travel etc. Just don't try and analyse it based on
real life space travel... Cosmos is available to watch if you want that
kind of thing.So to summarise, the film is enjoyable and would probably slot in
between Inception and The Prestige for me... (Not including the Batman
films) It wasn't just about Space though, family and love play a strong
part in driving this film forward which was a nice touch as Nolan
doesn't tend to explore that side of his characters too often.Overall this is an 8/10. I do need to see it again as I did struggle
piecing it all together at times, but I did this with Inception (now my
favourite film of all time), and the Matrix too (In my top 50)

Interstellar was a must see thrill ride into the depths of science
fiction and cinematic brilliance. With a star stellar cast, Christopher
Nolan captivates the audience with an urgency of exploration. Although
the physics and relativity can be very difficult to understand,
nonetheless the story can be followed and enjoyed. I completely
recommend seeing it in theaters to receive the full and complete
experience. The Nolan brothers just raised the bar for cinema, special
effects, story, creativity, and casting. To conclude, Interstellar will
take you on a journey across time, space, and dimensions to reach the
appropriate destination. You will leave the theater knowing you have
gotten your money's worth and more.

Quickie Review:Humanity faces extinction as the world can no longer produce the food
to sustain themselves. This leads to the choice of either exploring far
away worlds in search of a new home, or accepting the end, left to fade
into the dust. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and his team embark upon a
journey into deep space to find such a new home, and save the human
race along with his daughter. Director Christopher Nolan is well known
for his intricate and often complex stories, Interstellar is no
exception. Visuals are stunning, the soundtrack is impactful, and the
cast is strong with McConaughey being the excellent emotional anchor.
Unfortunately, when the intangible is explored the strangeness of the
ideas displayed can be distracting and pull you out of the moment.
Still this is a must see movie for successfully melding the ambitious
take on the sci-fi genre with the human drama.Full Review:Story-telling master Christopher Nolan, the recent McConaughaissance,
combined with sci-fi which sane movie lover would say no to that?! I
had to see it on the opening night and I expected to be blown away.
Thankfully as a whole Interstellar did deliver on the high
expectations, but I have to admit there is one problem with this movie
that bothers me enough to not give it the perfect score.Everyone in the cast did a great job but the standout by far is
McConaughey. He plays his character Cooper with incredible depth and
that helped a lot to make us care about what he's going through for his
daughter. Add all the visuals in the universe, but it won't make a
difference if the lead was not strong. So safe to say the
McConaughaissance is still going strong. The father-daughter
relationship is the emotional core, and they share some scenes together
that hit you right in the soft spot of your heart. As for two of your
five senses (six if you see ghosts) sound and sight, they are both in
for a delicious treat. Visually this movie is gorgeous, multiple times
my jaw dropped in awe. It is all the more impressive that for the first
time ever the black holes and worm holes have actual mathematical and
physics basis for how they have been depicted. Facts can be stranger
than fiction, strangely beautiful, and there are countless moments of
that in Interstellar. The sounds and music only help amplify the effect
of the visuals. More than once I was clenching my fist and biting my
fingers because of the intensity building up with Hans Zimmer's score.
I think this may be Zimmer's most unique soundtrack since Inception.My problems with the movie has to do with the story. Before I explain
further I have to be clear about this, I actually really like the
story. Nolan is meticulous with Interstellar, the amount of attention
given to the effect of scientific theories on the structure of the
story is impressive. This reminds me to caution you about the
scientific expositions given in the movie. All you need to know is how
gravity can affect time (general relativity), this is briefly explained
so pay attention to that fact to understand what's going on. You don't
need to be theoretical physicist to understand (but hey it wouldn't
hurt). Ultimately this brings me to my negative point, while the movie
excels at explaining the difficult but accepted scientific theories, it
fails when showcasing the currently intangible areas of science. It
forces the filmmaker to make artistic decisions on certain things that
may come off too strange for the audience to accept. These scenes were
really distracting for me, and I think it was for others as well
because I'd hear giggles for something that was supposed to be taken
seriously. Sorry for the vagueness, but I don't want to give away any
plot points.Honestly though, Interstellar is truly a special film with grand ideas
given in a deep narrative context. It's a blend that works almost
perfectly. Interstellar is thought provoking and I am sure you will be
having some long conversions with your friends and family afterwards.
Cast, visuals, music, is the trifecta that will make this movie stick
with you. Don't miss out on this one.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector:

This is my very first review on here although I have relied on IMDb
ratings and reviews for almost every film I watch, This is why I must
share my opinion on this particular movie. First of all this movie is so much more than your average ""Mind
bender"". It is a very emotional, intelligent, Psychological,
suspenseful, and action packed joy ride. The character development is
nice and you really feel emotionally bonded to the main characters. The
different number of emotions this film brings out of you is sheer
amazing in itself. Interstellar will keep you on the edge of your seat and you can never
really guess what is going to happen from scene to scene, however it is
really put together well, every scene in the movie is very important to
the plot and you must listen and follow along or you could be lost.The acting in this movie is superb and I believe the ""all star cast""
really shined in the spotlight. No one really underperformed and it
really helps you get emotionally bonded with the characters.The score is the best, most beautiful piece of work I've ever heard in
a film. Every scene fits perfectly with the music and heightens the
suspense and emotion that much more. Hans Zimmer really out did himself
with his work in this film. So all in all interstellar is just a cinematic masterpiece. It really
has everything you could ask for in a movie and really keeps you glued
to the screen for the entire 2 hours and 49 minutes. I have seen a lot
of movies, especially from IMDb's top 250 list, and I can say without a
doubt this is my favorite movie ever. I've never left a movie feeling
the way I did after watching Interstellar. It is definitely a must
watch!

Interstellar might be more realistically sound in creating a space-like
environment than any movie before.The Issues of the movie, whether noticed or ignored by the spectators,
is for visual and audio emotion to overcome logic and sense within the
story.The beginning is pretty good. The earth is displayed very interestingly
and tragically. The characters are introduced very effectively. The
point of the father and kids corralling that satellite with their truck
turned out to be for no real reason, but at the time it seemed a cool
and important moment. But the whole story up to them taking off for
space was mostly fine.The part of the movie that bothered me, and should bother everyone,
isn't the beginning and isn't the climax when McConnahey's Character
enters the black hole and communicates with his daughter through time.
The bookcase was a peculiar means, but overall that isn't the main
issue. The issue in the film is the entire journey leading up to him
entering the black hole. And then his choice to jump ship at the end.There didn't need to 3 separate planets to choose between. Think about
it. If there were two, they would have had no choice, but to go to
Damon's planet after the disaster at the first planet, and then going
into the black hole would have felt like the only option.The first planet only served the point of moving the earth story ahead
23 years. It made no sense for the one crew member who stayed on the
station to not spend almost all of his 23 years in stasis. Instead he
spent almost all that time ""not wasting his life"" by accomplishing
nothing by himself for 20 years. Just so when Hathaway and McConnahey
returned they could be shocked by seeing in front of them all of the
time that passed. And another complaint. How did they even return from
the planet. They lifted off earth in a Saturn 5 style rocket, in which
they left behind virtually all their liftoff power in takeoff. However,
they still managed to liftoff of the 2 other planets later with just
the fuselage engines. And that water planet had a stronger gravity than
earth. This allowed them to have the visual and emotional drama of a
rocket launch when McConnahey leaves his daughter. But there is no easy
way to write in multiple other rocket engines appearing magically in
space for future takeoffs. So they pretend afterward that they never
needed a rocket in the first place.Another giant complaint of mine is how earth was continually able to
send video messages to the people on the missions, but the people on
the missions couldn't send anything comparable back. Or if they could,
they just didn't for no sensible reason. Again, this is noticeable bad
writing in deciding to have visual and audio emotion overcome logic.
Hathaway after making decisions that lead to a crewman's death,
convincing McConnahey to go to the planet of her crush rather than the
planet of best life likelihood, is another example of emotion over
sense from a story writing standpoint. The sound served the same
purpose much of the time. It overshadowing the dialogue so feel could
mask their talking, which was often confusingly scientific,and
supernatural fused with philosophical. Those two things are often at
odds with each other. But they presented them as if all science deals
with both. They also often described things that the characters should
already known just because they are trying desperately to keep the
audience in the loop with what is going on.(bad writing) Anyway. The
decision to listen to Hathaway ends up being wrong. It would have
bothered me even more if it was right. But it leads to meeting Matt
Damon's character who turns out to be psychotic and selfish. More
unsuccessful drama building with the music and visual overshadowing the
story aspects which really weren't too strong. All of this leads to
McConnahey's character unexpectedly(which shouldn't have been the
feeling) jumping into the black hole which magically does allow him to
save everything.The story, to remain inconsistent and irritating, does the complete
opposite of emotion over logic later in the story. When father and
daughter finally reunite.(His daughter is now on her death bed despite
no explanation to how she went form McConnahey's age to way older)
McConnahey is finally there for his family. But next minute he leaves
to go after Hathaway in space. Getting back to his daughter was
supposed to be the main character's goal after saving the planet. But
when he finally actually does return, all he can do is leave again. I
don't care if the daughter was old or if she told him to go. She had an
entire family that would have loved him to be a family member again.
Even if it was for a week or something. We don't even know how much
aging might have happened to Hathaway in that time. It would make sense
to think that the black hole was what kept McConnahey's character young
as time sped forward for everyone else. This means that the main
character picks Hathaway's character over his daughter, who saved
everyone and is now on her death bed. Hathaway meanwhile accidentally
made decisions that killed a crew member, chose love over logical
science as a scientist to disastrous consequences, had a father who was
a traitor and liar to everyone, and she is now old and possibly dead.WHY DO SO MANY PEOPLE SKIP OVER ALL THE MOVIE'S PROBLEMS?

Hollywood science fiction spectacles about antagonistic aliens
abandoning dying worlds to occupy not only Earth, but also to oust us
have been popular with moviegoers. Typically, like the European
explorers who invaded and disenfranchised millions in the Western
Hemisphere during the 15th century, these extraterrestrialseither
bug-eyed behemoths with lobster claws or pod people whose seeds have
drifted across the cosmosshow up to evict or absorb us. ""Inception""
director Christopher Nolan's latest extravaganza ""Interstellar,""
toplining Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael
Caine, and John Lithgow, is a superior space opera that reverses the
action. Earthlings must abandon mother Earth because an environmental
blight has devastated farming and millions have starved to death in
overpopulated continents. No, ""Interstellar"" doesn't pit Earth against
multi-colored ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" aliens or immaculate looking
storm troopers in white outfits from the ""Star Wars"" and ""Hunger Games""
franchises. Instead, the ""Interstellar"" scientist heroes must search
for a new home for humankind. Rather than an outlandish adventure epic
with evil extraterrestrials, ""Interstellar"" qualifies as an
intelligent, realistic, sometimes provocative, sci-fi saga similar to
Stanley Kubrick's landmark movie ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Mind you,
Nolan doesn't chronicle mankind's evolution from the dawn of time the
way Kubrick did in as ""2001."" The casts of ""Interstellar"" and ""2001: A
Space Odyssey"" differ, too. Kubrick relied on an unknown cast, while
""Interstellar"" boasts a charismatic array of superstars. If you haven't
seen ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" you won't appreciate some of the clever
allusions to the legendary 1968 film. Anybody who has seen ""2001"" will
be amused by a joke that a robot makes about blowing an astronaut out
of an airlock. Ultimately, the most obvious ""2001"" references in
""Interstellar"" are those bizarre, oblong, Minecraft-style robots that
resemble the black monoliths in Kubrick's film. Some of the sci-fi
terminology may fly over your head, but Christopher Nolan and his
brother Jonathan concern themselves with more than speculative science
fiction ideas. They focus on relevant contemporary themes, such as
father & daughter relationships and the environment. They forge
interesting characters with philosophical dialogue that you will ponder
long after the movie. ""Interstellar"" occurs in the late 21st century, after things have waxed
really wretched. Bad enough that farmers can grow only corn. Blight has
destroyed wheat and okra. Public opinion about NASA has curdled.
History textbooks have been rewritten. Everybody believes NASA faked
the Apollo moon landings to bankrupt the Soviet Union. A former NASA
test pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey of ""Mud""), has turned to
farming and reaped rewards where many others have failed. Although his
wife died from a brain cyst that an MRI could have detected had an MRI
had been available, Cooper perseveres as a farmer and a father of two
children, his fifteen-year old son Tom (Timothée Chalamet of ""Worse
Friends""), and his precious ten-year old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy
of ""The Conjuring"") who adore him. Cooper and his kids live with his
father-in-law, Donald (John Lithgow of ""Terms of Endearment""), and they
contend with tumultuous dust storms on a daily basis. These dust storms
recall the Depression Era drought and dust storms of that prompted
millions to flee from the plains states. Dust gets into everything, and
Donald wages a never-ending war to keep everything clean. Meanwhile,
books have been toppling randomly from Murph's bedroom bookcase. She
suspects a ghost is responsible, but nothing ghoulish like ""Paranormal
Activity."" Naturally, Cooper dismisses the presence of ghosts. One day
after a particularly turbulent dust storm, father and daughter examine
the way the books have fallen out of the shelves, translate it into
code, and come up with coordinates that lead them to a classified NORAD
facility. A monolithic robot named Tars confronts them. Later, Murph
and Cooper find themselves sitting around a table talking with
high-ranking NASA officials. One of them is Professor Brand (Michael
Caine of ""Batman Begins""), and Brand confides in Cooper that the world
is living on borrowed time. Moreover, he tells him about the 'Lazarus'
project. NASA has dispatched manned missions to other parts of the
galaxy to find a new home for mankind. He convinces Cooper to sign on
as a pilot for one last launch that will take his daughter, biologist
Amelia (Oscar winning actress Anne Hathaway of ""Les Misérables);
physicist Romilly (David Gyasi); geographer Doyle (Wes Bentley of ""The
Hunger Games""); and two robots TARS (voice of Bill Irwin) and CASE
(voice of Josh Stewart) deep into space to a recently discovered
wormhole which will enable them to explore new worlds. Predictably,
Murph isn't happy about her father's departure. During their flight to
the wormhole, Cooper and company lose contact with Earth, but Professor
Brand can still transmit messages. Gradually, however, things take a
turn for the worst. The final quarter hour of ""Interstellar"" will
absolutely boggle your mind. Cooper goes where no man has gone before
in a desperate bid to save mankind! ""Interstellar"" is a serious sci-fi movie. The computer-generated visual
effects are nothing short of dazzling, and Nolan orchestrates the
flight sequences so we don't hear any sounds in the vacuum of outer
space. The different spacecraft and the Endurance mother ship look as
authentic as the outfits that our heroes wear. The strange but new
worlds that they encounter during their search to locate a new Earth
are breathtaking. One world consists of an eternal sea with towering
waves that loom like mountain ranges, while another is as stark and icy
as it is inhospitable. The theme of deception runs throughout
""Interstellar."" The faked Apollo moon landing and Dr. Brand's
mind-blowing revelation are a few surprises that will maintain your
interest throughout ""Interstellar."" Nolan generates several suspenseful
set-pieces that will keep you poised on the edge of your seat. Matt
Damon has a startling cameo as another astronaut who has succumbed to
effects of isolation. Clocking in at 169 minutes, ""Interstellar""
amounts to an unforgettable epic with intense white-knuckled suspense,
top-notch performances, and a terrific ending.

What a glorious way to demonstrate the richest of the skills of
film-making!! Kudos must go to Nolan. It's a sci-fi treat blended
beautifully with emotions, an excellent original work in the era of
mostly non-original movies. The direction and story is exceptional in
many ways and this is what we expect from Nolan. Acting is good,
especially, the acting of all the three females is excellent in the
movie. Visuals are amazing. Music is good but I expected even better
from Hans Zimmer. The expansion of scope for the future of the human
race is amazing. Yes, it has some similarities with '2001- A Space
Odyssey (1968)' but surely and most certainly 'Interstellar' is a next
generation movie. The end part of the movie has been talked about a
lot. It is very heavy, very happening and very complex. They say
'Seeing is believing'. The important thing here is that seeing means
seeing and understanding it well too. This part is the soul of the
movie; it's the part where millions of the scattered dots of the whole
movie show how well they are bonded. In order to find what this movie
is all about, it is necessary to understand it. For me, especially
three things in this end part were very very important- 1) the use of
the 'Time' dimension out of the five dimensions talked about in the
movie. 2) the role of 'Gravity' as a means to communicate across the
dimensions and 3) the position of the humans in a far distant future.
The only problem seems to be is the slow pace. This movie is a fine
example of the trade-off between an experience of reality in a movie
and a good pace of it. I believe that a classic movie of this stature
deserves this kind of elaboration and so this pace too. But, from many
viewers' point of view, well, the idea may be a bit different. So, the
jury is still out. Finally, 'Interstellar' is yet another masterpiece
from Nolan, the best movie of last two years. 9/10

dear mr.Nolan,. thanks for such experience. This is ONLY MOVIE THAT CAN
STAND SIDE BY SIDE WITH ODISEY 2001. I am an vfx artist, father of a
baby girl, and for me there was not a single moment in a movie in which
i did not feel empathy for protagonists. Movie in intellectual,
emotional, enough FX, and enough SciFi, but story telling pace is
perfect, metodic, ....it is a bit difficult for me to find proper
sentience construction in English to describe how amazed am I ,but also
satisfied tonight. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone.p.s. One very strange thing. movie is EDITED with such excellency that
give you more than clear impression of DETAILS in this movie, so beside
this excitement I don't have a need to watch this movie again,
everything is clear and easy to remember,. bravo mr.Nolan., this fact
alone is a special art.Sorry to repeat myself, but big WOOW to whole crew on this movie,
especially to minds behind script, editing and art direction, and jet
once more, to mr.Nolan.balabanGoran vimeo.com/user7763044

(Warning: This article contains plenty of spoilers and reveal the
conclusion of the film) Interstellar contains high production value, a
beautiful score by Mr. Zimmer, and as least as breathtaking as Gravity.
This time Mr. Nolan tells the story without the need of multiple layers
(a la Inception), making stupid person like me easy to grasp the plot.
But something is not very good with the last 10 or 15 min. of the film.
A man flies through 50 years or more, make his return only to see the
woman (girl) he loves become an old lady? C'mon, this is EXACTLY THE
SAME with a Japanese cartoon movie, Gekijouban Kidou senshi Gandamu 00:
A wakening of the trailblazer (Mobile Suit Gundam 00 the Movie:
Awakening of the Trailblazer, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1726286/). In
that Gundam movie, the rendezvous takes place at the 3-minutes extra
scenes after the end credit roll. Even bigger issue, I guessed this
dated back to Oct. 16th, and no one shook the bookshelf to fore- tell.
(you'll know this line after seeing this film) In addition, the space
colony at the end of the film is 90% copycat from Elysium, earth
surfaces are curved. And I'm quite sure design concept of space colony
in Elysium is influenced to some extend from the space colonies in the
Gundam universe. (in face, Interstellar can be view as the prequel to
the Gundam universe!) Maybe that's why all space station scenes take
place in the interior and ext. of space station never shown. Lots of
audience fear this film is even more difficult to understand than
""Inception"". This is because they want to gain 100% scientifically
correct explanation on what happens if someone falls into the Black
Hole. My strategy is, disregard all the hard science terms and enjoy
the ride. p.s. Disney may have real problem if they really plans to
remake ""The Black Hole"".
"

I am well aware of comparisons to various films such as the obvious
""2001: A space odyssey, Solaris, Gravity(in some respects)"" but this
picture is, in my opinion of such importance to the ongoing evolution
of film that I would prefer to look at it based on its own merits.
(other than a single reference below....) It has taken me a few months
and more than a couple viewings of this film to form what I HOPE is a
well rounded personal opinion. Upon my first viewing I must admit I had
completely and wholeheartedly given into the hype, as much as I tried
not to, I could not wait to see it, and fully expected to be let down.
It did not disappoint but in many ways surprised me with its subtlety.The start of this movie is very gentle in areas, setting out a family
scene. Emotional entanglements which run throughout the film are deep,
heart wrenching but at times heart warming. It becomes clear very
quickly that this is not a film looking to mollycoddle the future,
things are bleak, but in a personal way. The world is not what it once
was, and we are running out of time. This film is not a crowd pleaser
in the same way as many blockbuster superhero movies and the like are.The imagery in this picture is literally out of this world, everything
just looks so tangible, the techniques employed during production of
this film though not ground breaking in some cases were definitely
unique and I would direct any accusations of overuse of CGI etc to look
a little deeper. I feel that the techniques used are blatantly obvious
and give a feeling of realness which is so often absent from what is
essentially a scifi flick. The interaction between actors and the
outside world (while in space) is fantastic, the acting overall in my
opinion is first class. I must mention however that Michael Caine's
performance was a little forgetful, though perhaps that was down to his
character and my thoughts on him being one of the greats. A Nolanite? I certainly am not, however I do think he is a massively
talented person. The soundtrack is still a bit(cure all Hans Zimmerish)
in that it couldn't have come from anyone else, but does enough to
separate itself from previous outings (Inception,TDK etc.) and is, in a
word, Sublime. A tad over emotional but it helps you connect with the
characters and the unfolding story. When paired with Hans Zimmer, their
success might get a bit repetitive but since when is that a bad thing.
They are both successful for a reason, because when paired, or alone,
they deliver.I do understand that to some people this really just isn't their bag,
and I applaud them for this. However I must say that I don't entirely
understand some of the criticism this film received regarding,
specifically, its science. Yes some of it goes against common sense,
but history has put paid to a lot of things which once made no sense
and are now commonplace. Yes there are oversights, such as the massive
wave which doesn't suck the water which precedes it, (like a tsunami)
and the underdevelopment of Coopers Son's character, but with regard
the bigger ideas, at the end of the day this is a film heavily based on
theoretical physics which has had a lot of work by various people far
smarter than I, to establish our best guesstimate at what all of those
theories would look and feel like if we were to interact with them. Its
still a film, this is not a documentary, though it bases itself heavily
on well thought out theories, I don't see anything wrong with taking
some artistic license. I don't suspect a ship entering a black hole
would stay intact but I am quite glad that the film didn't end there. I
realise it may annoy some people to say this but with respect, is it
really being suggested that what is an all time classic ""2001: A space
odyssey"" is more deeply rooted in science than Interstellar?I guess what I don't get, is how we can rubbish a film based on theory
when the very nature of theory is that we aren't really sure to begin
with. However even if it all turned out to be a load of junk, I still
love this film for its marriage of Theoretical science and what I very
personally see as art. I do think that Christopher Nolan is in some
ways challenging us as humans, there are things we don't understand and
furthermore concepts which are hinted at, which even the smartest of us
simply cant really comprehend. The soul of this film for me is to be
found in accepting there are things we don't know and allowing the
concepts, emotions and visuals which we do understand, to come all at
once and enjoy, remember and learn from the experience.This film poses some uncomfortable questions as regards where we are
heading, it cant be looked past that the possibilities of natural
disasters occurring goes up minute by minute. The resilience of human
nature, our capacity to love and always at least attempt to overcome is
showcased here within a mix for theoretical science and amazing
imagery/writing delivered by top class actors, yes there are mistakes
and holes but there is so much that is overwhelmingly brilliant that I
simply do no care.. Overall, I must say, this is just about the best
film I have ever seen. Definitely not my favourite Nolan film, but as a
technical/artistic achievement, it will take some beating.
"

I admit it took time to open my mind and see this movie knowing that
this is a science fiction, contrary to my expectation of a non- fiction
depiction of what astronauts and physicists and innovators do to give
us a better understanding of what lies out there. That and having
Matthew McConaughey as the lead is all I have when I sat down for this
movie. And I am so ashamed! I should have known better. I couldn't help being
reminded by The Dark Knight upon seeing Michael Caine and Anne
Hathaway. The Batman trilogy just happened to be my favorite of movies.
And then I thought of Inception. Like those movies, I was completely
blown away by this film's every situation, always anticipating even in
the slightest action and attentive to every conversation. And, man, my
""suspicion"" was confirmed at the end of the movie! That explains
everything!!!I will never ever regret spending my 2 hours and 45 minutes on this
movie which made me feel almost every sort of emotion. Christopher
Nolan is no doubt a genius in giving us movies worth our time and
money, and emotions. What he did with Interstellar is an achievement
and seeing this film is a milestone. Did I mention I am a very big fan
of NASA, astronomy, space exploration and Christopher Nolan? Combining
them all turned out to be a tremendous success!I'd say Matthew McConaughey's performance is memorable. A father's
promise and love knows no space, time or dimension. Anne Hathaway's
determination to follow her heart is uncontainable. The screenplay?
Fantastic and scientifically accurate as possible! Music? Original.
Thank you Hans Zimmer! Visual effects? Very realistic! Satisfaction is
guaranteed.Interstellar is a masterpiece and Christopher Nolan is the maestro.
"
368,10,"
Interstellar is a stellar movie for sure! :D It has everything you
expect to be in a Sci-Fi space travel film. From the beginning till the
end the movie doesn't lose it's plot or pace. The story is not just
about a mission for mankind's survival but it also teaches us to have
faith in Humanity & Love. The film score composed by Hans Zimmer is
beautiful. I really like how they made use of practical effects along
with CGI special effects & made the interstellar travel so appealing to
look at. If compared to Gravity (which almost everyone does), I'd
prefer to watch Interstellar again & again without any doubt. Nothing
in the movie made me feel confused, just curious. I watched this movie
on DVD, I didn't get a chance to watch it in theater or else I would've
enjoyed it even more. I don't care much about the Science behind this
film because I felt it still was a complete Sci-Fi adventure.

Having looked at many of the earlier reviews I was staggered at much of
their orgasmic nature. This film is good, and well worth a visit to the
cinema to see it. The imagery is excellent as we have come to expect
from Christopher Nolan. The acting is OK but not Oscar winning - in
fact some of Matthew McConaughey and his Texan drawl does get a bit
tiresome by the end. The story itself inspires much thought, but not in
the same way as Inception - that is quite a good thing really as your
brain doesn't have to work quite as hard to keep up. Seriously it is an
OK film and a good watch, albeit a tad too long - but the last 20
minutes is weird, a little rushed, and could easily be dropped. Don't
let my comments in any way put you off seeing the movie, but please
don't expect 10 out of 10 unless you are very easily pleased.
"
370,7,"
I will try to keep this review spoiler free.Christopher Nolan has many followers and haters. Personally, I
thoroughly enjoy his films and he knows how to play with peoples
emotions in movies like Inception and The Dark Knight. Interstellar is
his latest movie and it already is in the Top 25 on IMDb's Top 250
list. But is it really that amazing? No. But it still will leave you
satisfied as a crowd pleasing experience.Basically, Earth is going to die. So Pilot/Farmer Cooper and a team of
astronauts go through a wormhole to find a new planet. But time is
precious and the world is aging.First the big problem I had just to get off my chest was the sound
mixing. While most of the film has no problems. A loud rumbling can be
heard (from what I experienced seeing it in 35mm film) in the last
quarter of the film which makes some of the dialog inaudible. Even when
the actors are screaming, you can barely hear them because of this
noise. But anyways...The film has a bit of comic sense that sometimes lacks in Nolan's
films. But because of the content, you will need some cheering up with
comic relief characters. Bill Irwin as the voice of Tars is great and
at first glance looks silly as a robot, but you come to love this
character bringing unexpected depth to him.The visuals are outstanding. Like with Inception, Interstellar has some
great and realistic visuals to help believe that we are actually in
space including some that are very surreal.The movie is more complex then his Dark Knight Films mostly due to the
fact that there are many themes of space exploration and theories about
black holes including an ending that will sure be a head twister.Everyone did amazing especially Anne Hathaway in her Second Nolan film
appearance including Matt Damon in a role I will not spoil. This is what I personally think as not a Fan-boy or a hater. See it for
yourself to judge. A few minutes could have been trimmed due to pacing
but anyways let me finish this review off.Interstellar is not the best Nolan Film. But it definitely is a crowd
pleasing movie that has amazing visuals, great acting and a good story.
I saw this in 35MM film but see it in 70MM IMAX if it is playing near
you. You will not regret it.78/100 B

Nolan's Inter-ception.'Interstellar' stands out among other films, mainly due to its mind
twisting style. We know and love Christopher Nolan for his notable plot
style, shown in such good films as Prestige or Inception. Obviously,
it's Christopher's passion to twist audience's minds. But this time it
he outsmarted himself. Although, the film lasts almost 3 hours, it
still seems not enough to tell such a huge story. The scenario covers
almost a hundred year period. To fit these, a lot of scenes were
unshown and therefore complex relationships things on the screen become
even more complicated. The film plot lacks the feeling of enormous
importance. The lives of the whole humanity depended on the result of
one mission. Keeping this in mind, some scenes seem especially
strange.From the farmer who randomly bumped into the ""world's most
secret"" NASA base in the corn field and was sent into space on the next
day, to the strange behavior of main characters. This makes the film
unbelievable. Concerning the moral aspect, the storyline touches many
discussable questions. Main of them sounds like: ""Will you leave your
family dying, attempting to save the world, or die with them?"". It's
easy to believe that little girl just don't want to let her father go.
But a grown up scientist, the interstellar crew must understand the
insignificance of personal demands, behind the duty of humanity. The
unreality and unseriousness of the plot, combined with irrational
behavior of the main characters make it hard to feel for them. But the
mind blowing film style can also surprise even experienced viewer. The
complexity of the plot helped the director to bring into life, his most
ambitious ideas. That's worth to be praised.
"
372,1,"
Well,where should I start,it's really bad,bad,BAD story. First of all,I
have feeling that they didn't invest enough money for movie set,its
kinda poor. People who watched this movie with me,are also disappointed
because of the story and set. Also they use some science facts that are
not truth,that facts are not even combined right,there are lot of holes
in their screenplay. I struggled to stay awake. Honestly for me this is
the worst movie in history,with no future.The idea of this movie is
good,but they didn't achieved that. I don't know,Iam not an expert for
commenting but my point is that this movie is not even worth to watch
it,honestly I don't give it a chance. So it on you people.
"
373,10,"
Interstellar is excellent piece of work by the man Nolan. I will not
say much but one thing i agree with a lot of people is you either love
it or you hate it. Don't waste time go and see the movie. All the
actors were perfect for their character. What can i say about Zimmer.
All i can say is that it was full of emotion, so well done to all.
Awaiting for the next big project of which I'm sure will rock. My
favorite movie of all time was dark knight however Interstellar joins
in front together. I waited for a long time for this movie and it did
not disappoint me so it was worth waiting for. I shall go and see the
movie again
"
374,10,"
I can say it is a better Gravity. I can nitpick about a lot of details
in this movie. I am sure I remember seeing some plot holes, but I kind
of forgot them. If I were to do the math on the relativity, I am sure
it won't count up. I suspect this is a movie for males and scientists,
though. I don't think I can explain why this movie made me cry to 95%
of the people out there, so I won't even try here.In the end it is about how this movie touched me, so I can't give it a
9 or lower. I'd give it a 9.5 if I can because I don't believe in 10's.Can't say this movie had me on the tip of my chair all the way through.
Never thought I would rate it this high halfway through the movie. I
guess the ending did it for me.
"
375,10,"
Some people say nolan should not make movies like this. An average
person can't understand it. Well, if you can't understand it raise your
standard. It was a perfect movie with best acting by academy award
winner Matthew McConaughey and also by Anne Hathaway. Very good music,
very good screenplay and above all best example of directing by
Christopher Nolan. The suspense, the thrill, was just awesome. Although
to make up the story the first part of movie was boring at some points
but rest was awesome. Nolan is one of the best filmmakers of our time.
Movie also had pure emotional touch also it was comical at some places.
The use of physics was remarkable.IT IS A MASTERPIECE.

A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure
humanity's survival.Going into this I had mixed feelings because some have praised it,
others have panned it, and some say it is good with reservations. There
were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of
other issues. Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets
nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors.This was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew
McConaughey or Anne Hathaway. Though, the fact that a ""Hathaway hater""
like myself enjoyed it should say something. And I think Jessica
Chastain should have received a Best Supporting nomination. She easily
outshines Laura Dern in ""Wild"".This may be the greatest ever film about physics.
"
377,10,"
It's long, but you rarely feel it, and when it approaches its end,
you're not ready. It felt like a demonstration of both the futility of
life and it's preciousness somehow fused simultaneously.I came for the space opera, I left with an emotional experience. The
views were spectacular, a black hole, a worm hole, time dilation, 5th
dimension, other inconceivable worlds: I'll be thinking about this
movie for a while.The film is decidedly unpolitical and free of agendas. Worth seeing. Worth owning. Worth your time.One of the best sci-fi films in ages.
"
378,10,"
It's really hard to know where to begin with a film like this, with its
attached anticipation of greatness. Few critics can be said to have
accused the director of making a bad film, most tend to agree that the
vast body of his work is very good, and he draws talented cast members
and skilled technicians to his projects. This film also has the
advantage of being released when the public, at least in the US, is
teetering on the brink of renewing its interest in scientific
advancement and exploration of the cosmos, thanks in large part to
celebrity scientists such as Bill Nye and Neil DeGrasse Tyson. And
while the idea of a sci fi exploration film is hardly new, one might
argue that this is the first of its type for a generation of films-
keeping in mind that certain films such as Gravity at least cross into
the same genre to some degree.With that in mind, it shouldn't surprise any viewers to find that this
territory feels familiar from the start of the film. The rural backdrop
contrasted by technology accompanied by an energetic and wistful
protagonist, the kids he raises to think freely against the system, a
haunted past both in the main character's personal and professional
life, mysterious compounds in the middle of nowhere, etc. All these
elements are a staple of the explorer's journey, but it is right to say
that what is familiar is done right and engages the audience. The film
hits its beats right in this regard, and these elements are handled
competently.But what makes Interstellar stand out is the authenticity of its
fictional narrative. There was a great degree of effort put forth to
make certain the physics and engineering reflected current knowledge
and leading theoretical science, and it shows. There's even talk that
the computer models used to give a more accurate picture of a black
hole actually advanced astrophysics by leading to discoveries and
insights about the warped curvature of space time in such an
environment as a singularity produces. Many films can be said to have
advanced film making technology, and credit is due there, but few if
any can actually be credited with driving the understanding of science.
Going into the movie with this idea in mind definitely augmented my
experience with the film, and I can only imagine it did so for others.One thing I can't help but notice is how well handled the hero
narrative is in this film, relying not on creating overly stylized
alpha males and sassy spark plugs, but instead having them quietly step
up with no fanfare, no glory, and no one liners, doing what is
necessary or making the required sacrifices. Our heroes are tormented
by mistakes, torn by their emotional conflicts, and vulnerable when it
comes to what they love. It's high time this archetype was made more
common IMO, and I wait to see if this film has the kind of success
which encourages such well defined characteristics in a protagonist.
Given the effectiveness of the narrative, it gives one hope.Having those aspects combined together with an incredible score, first
rate performances, and an intelligent script, Interstellar delivers an
amazing cinematic experience. If there were any criticisms I might
level at the film, that would be its unmistakable homages to 2001: A
Space Odyssey and its somewhat languid pace at times. But these are
subjective observations, and should not discourage viewing only for
those reasons, which hardly impact the film. I'm giving Interstellar
its well deserved 10/10, and recommending it for both imaginative young
minds and those adults who never stopped dreaming.
"
379,10,"
I am writing this to just say if you love science and space this is the
movie to go watch before you die. I am simply enthralled and it is as I
always like my entertainment to be, start slowly, gradually build up
and bam like an orgasm it ends. It is one of the finest movies made in
the history. But as many people who went with me couldn't comprehend
the sheer genius of the filmmaker and the space time complexity so if
you are one of them that don't want to understand and just want
something happening that doesn't utilize your neurons then I guess
don't watch it. To say the least, if I were a girl I would let Nolans'
brain do it with me any time.
"
380,10,"
The most original story I have ever seen and the most realistic view of
space ever depicted of film. The complicated plot points in this one is
sky high even surpassing the imagination made that based Inception. The
plot made this movie just makes it harder to direct for Christopher
Nolan. It is not a question that the screenplay of this film isn't the
best work of Nolan but who the hell cares, no one could do it any
better than Nolan himself with this unbelievable script.I was literally mind blown from the dialogue and script. The movie
itself made me question my very existence. This life changing film
creates possibilities and new theories on space and time. How gravity
and love could help you communicate with the past physically and the
concept of the 5th dimension in the black hole that let's you
communicate with the 3rd dimension just boggled my mind. It creates
goosebumps on what could happen if interstellar travel is possible and
if gravity and time relativity could really do equate. The concept of
love in this movie as a feeling that even surpasses time, galaxy, and
existence made my eyes tear, making it also a great drama.People say that great ideas alone does not make great movies but just
the mere fact that this really big idea was portrayed in film is
unbelievable and should be given credit for. People compare it to
Kubrick's work, but it isn't just a typical 2001 Space Odyssey clone
like most people say it is. It borrowed the same elements but injected
in new ones. The truth is I don't want to recommend this movie to any
typical moviegoer. The dialogue could be as boring as hell and the
movie won't be appreciated on what it really is. This 3 hour long film
is for the people who want a new story, who wants to widen their
imagination, who wants to know the value of love. Yes it is full of
flaws in directing as I explained because of the plot, but
understanding its urge, its ambition, you could understand this movie's
sense and value. This movie is a movie that you can both love and hate,
whether you choose to see its flaws or see its value is up to a viewer.
"
381,10,"
Interstellar is a jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring, beautiful, complex and
thrilling adventure.The film is a mix of Spielberg's warmth, Kubrick's
brain and Malick's beauty.Visually it is one of the best film ever made
if not the best. Totally, is it the best film ever made? i don't know.
A film of this scope and ambition is sure to have some narrative flaws
here and there but it is beyond my ability to judge a film like this
and find flaws in first viewing. May be i need to see it again to find
any flaws, hell why should i find flaws while enjoyed it immensely. Performances were great. Hans Zimmer music was terrific and loud at
times. Endurance docking and ghost subplot gave me chills. Some of the
stuff is hard to understand like the Gravitational singularity,
Relativity and 5 Dimensional space. But Nolan connected the dots
between them very efficiently and mixed them with love and humanity. If
you are a sucker for these things, the film will transcend you into it
or else it feels overly sentimental. Don't miss it. I recommend you to watch it in IMAX if possible.
"
382,10,"
As a sci-fi fan, who loves 2001 SO, Contact, Gravity and many other
movies that deal with with the topics also covered in Interstellar, I
have to say, I have no words to describe the movie. It just took me for
one hell of a ride! The score provided by Hans Zimmer was an
extraordinary piece of work. It fits the movie so well that it was like
the movie was made to fit the OST and not the other way around. There
is an interview with Christopher Nolan, in which he states that he
wouldn't allow Hans Zimmer to know exactly what the movie's plot device
is, he only told to him that he has to focus on the connection between
father and daughter. If this is the truth - WOW! it worked flawlessly!I won't go and describe what I saw on the big screen because this is
something that anyone that goes to see the movie has to experience for
himself... I can only tell you that after I saw the credits, I
attempted to get off my seat, it didn't worked. I tried again, pushing
harder - it barely worked. Moments after I was at the theater's exit
heading out for the bus. I saw it coming just right on time with me,
but I didn't get on. I was compelled to walk and think. Think of what I
saw... My head was aching, my ears too and my eyes were closing only to
call back images from the movie. I got home and found myself undressed
and dressed with my casual home clothes. Then I realized that I have
also walked the 7 kilometers road to my home without noticing... I was
still in the movie, I must definitely been, because only there the time
behaved the way I was feeling while coming home...
"
383,10,"
One thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never
a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair
but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in
Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the
interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte.
The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off
the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable
sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film.
At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand
film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated,
visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work
to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction
ever released.
"
384,10,"
I found Interstellar:Extraordinarily Original - I foresaw very little of what would be
happening in the movie. Every scene was new, refreshing, and grippingScientifically Engaging - As a kid I was fascinated with wormholes,
space, black holes, time travel, and space exploration. This movie
managed to weave those fantasies into a compelling story. Who would
think that special relativity could be so central to a blockbuster
film?Emotionally Touching - I felt like I was able to connect to both Murph
and Cooper, and felt both extreme sadness and extreme joy as I followed
along with their relationship.Overwhelmingly Human - This movie probes deeply into the human need to
explore, instinct to survive, and capacity to love. The stories around
these three themes are compelling and novel since each of the themes
are tested in extreme ways.Intensely Satisfying - The dual climax of the film was gripping, and I
was really happy with the ending and how all of the loose threads were
tied together.Amusingly Cute - The robots were really fun (especially when they're
rolling around). Hearing the main characters use their physics jargon
was really fun too (""quantum data"" and ""solving the gravity equation""
he-he).

While classified as Science Fiction, ""Interstellar"" is much more about
its characters than it is about outer space.Co-Writer/Director Christopher Nolan has a very antiseptic approach to
film. His movies have a clinical, clean room feel to them. So, emotions
in his films often fall to the background.And, because of that, I often feel that I am being kept at arm's length
by his films. But, what makes ""Interstellar"" work are the actors,
especially Matthew McConaughey. He gives a great performance that could
have easily gained him another Best Actor Oscar if this weren't a
Science-Fiction film.The other actors also do a great job, and that's what makes the film
work. There is a lot of science to absorb, and I am sure that could be
challenging for those who don't watch Science Channel's space-
programming block every week!But, it is the characters, and the performances that carry the movie.
When you get to the end, that's where I choked up. And, it was because
of that. The story has lots of good stuff in it, but that isn't why you
care about what happens.Hans Zimmer delivers yet another excellent film score! He is probably
the one great film composer working today, besides John Williams, whose
work is legendary.********* (9 Out of 10 Stars)

What were we to expect? I mean, what do you get when you take Matthew
McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Matt Damon, the Nolan
Brothers and Others to make a single movie? Well you have a lot of
dependable names so we call them ""The Dependables"" for great acting,
directing, etc. (Sorry no Stallone though) With so much talent you
would kind of anticipate a movie in which everything technical - from
directing and cinematography to acting and music to be well done. And
that is definitely he case for Interstellar - simple as that. PS the
Bluray version is excellent :)This story brilliantly navigates plot holes like a NASA pilot. The
story starts amidst some unexplained global apocalypse which causes a
lot of sandstorms and other plagues that keep killing farm crops. The
cause is never really made clear, but considering the movie lasts
almost three hours I can hardly blame them for trying to keep it on
point. This catastrophe's solution lies at the center of a black hole,
to which at least two characters arrive to alive - again without great
technical detail provided. Or why obscure Morse code on a watch was
used instead of a simple analogue typewriter to pass back the quantum
data via ""gravity beams""? I mean - dunno 'bout you all but my Morse
sucks. Hell why not just paint it on the side of corn silo for that
matter. Spray cans cant' be that much of a challenge for gravity beams,
cmon now..But to debate all of the theoretical loopholes here is probably like
arguing that lightsabers and ""the Force"" don't really exist, so again
kudos for staying on point with the part of the story that most viewers
will actually care about.And that's the part that is done really well here. So if you are
looking for Arthur C. Clarke's 2001 (which put me to sleep) then this
might not be for you. But if you liked Star Trek or Titanic or any big
movie where you are willing to ignore any and all inaccuracies, relax
and be entertained then this is definitely something you might like. I
mean after all, it did win and Oscar for Best Achievement in Visual
Effects so on that basis alone it's a good watch.

I thought this movie was phenomenal! This details in all the science
behind a concept so complex was so well thought out, I questioned half
way through if scientists had created the plot.The fact is Interstellar
blew me away, not on a CGI level but in terms of visuals, nostalgia,
acting and reliability. In every movie there is a good guy and a bad
guy, but with Interstellar human kind or life itself was the enemy and
the fact we can relate to it because we'll be in that same situation
within the next 30 years makes the movie more amazing. Interstellar
could have been a simple space voyage, but by adding a family in which
could relate too and feel for them makes Interstellar a masterpiece
IMO.﻿ I'm a bit biased though because I've always been a huge Nolan
fan, but I still think it's absolutely incredible. I would just bring a
pen and paper to take some notes.

Interstellar is about the future where our planet has literally turned
to dust and schools have rubbished achievements like Apollo Space
Mission to keep the last generation of human population in dark about
the glorious past and the inglorious past that resulted in this
present.....I see a powerful work of imagery excellently portrayed on-
screen....Nolan loyalists voice their disappointments about implausible
track of the movie only because they expect absolute logic from the
master filmmaker.....But since my knowledge about the black holes and
laws governing it are next to nil, I saw the movie as a story, and in
stories there is no need to adhere to any laws.Full marks to
Interstellar. Read More on electrongal.blogspot.in/2014/11/of-science-and-imagination

Watched the movie in the 70 mm I-MAX theater; and enjoyed the movie.Once again Mr.Christopher Nolan unfolds a beyond
imagination'masterpiece' through SCI-Fi space journey.Every time, he comes up with his ideas, which makes the audience you go
crazy and speechless.The performances were excellent. Matthew McConaughey is brilliant &
Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain does their part very
good.The visuals were outstanding. Hans Zimmer's background score was
amazing and blended perfectly with the film.

The world is changing. And it's changing for the worst. Crops are
dying. Food-crisis is taking over the interests in technology. ""People
don't really want engineers but farmers"" as one powerfully states.
Throwing away hefty share of funds in scientific research & space
missions are no more concern of priority. So, NASA is forced to go
underground. Human race has the fear to lose its existence, sooner than
we believe. One of most intelligent minds at the premise (the veteran
Michael Caine) opens up, ""We are not meant to save the world. We are
meant to leave it"".Decoding Christopher Nolan's mesmeric & equally mystifying world of
gigantic prospects irrespective of time & place (mostly space in this
case) is the trickiest job for any common movie-watcher like me. So
coming up with a proclamation like 'I am fully done with it"", is
nothing but a steep example of audaciousness! I wouldn't dare! An
Ex-NASA pilot Cooper (Played by Matthew McConaughey) is now a farmer
with two of his kids & an old father to deal with. Some strange events
and his exploratory eyes to see things in their scientific orientation
lands him to a space-mission responsibly designed to locate possible
rescue-stations in outer world to reinstate mankind in space-colonies.
And then starts the tremendously amazing expedition filled with moments
of fear, panicky situations, killing betrayals and affecting insights
about life.INTERSTELLAR is a 2hour 50min long canvas of a highly competent &
thoroughly manipulative mind called Nolan. He cleverly makes you
resting with the most vividly done human emotions in a very enigmatic
way and then knocks you off with the layered plots revealing in the
most outrageous manner. No wonder if in the first half, you only wait
for the 'Nolan-effect' (earned authoritatively after the extravagant
thriller 'INCEPTION') to come and squash & squeeze you from left, right
and center, the second half does the needful in more ways than you
would imagine. With an astonishing camera-work and persuasive
background score by Hans Zimmer, INTERSTELLAR takes you through
galaxies, planets with extreme climates, grasping black holes and
radiant light patterns falling over various space-objects like some
ravishing fireworks in the sky.INTERSTELLAR fills you with a magnanimous feeling of being in a
celestial world that is enticing to the core, unbelievably real and
assertively sharp. Traveling through different time-zones and the race
against time to save humanity creates an effervescent, tensed yet
disturbingly calm mood to be felt much longer. McConaughey's rigidly in
skin characterization gives film a strong reason to watch. Watch him
going through the video messages from his family on earth over the
period of 23 long years or him leading the space-expedition with total
conviction, he dons the hat of a skilled performer in both. Anne
Hathaway as Cooper's fellow explorer doesn't impress much though it is
not a wasted performance. Jessica Chastain in the role of Cooper's
daughter shines. Matt Damon's is a shocking surprise best left
undisclosed much.With a much longer duration, your past gratifying tryst with Alfonso
Cuaron's masterstroke GRAVITY and the astronomical usage of science
terminology, film might incite killing impatience in you but just have
faith in Chris Nolan and his successive idea to shock, thrill & stun
you, despite all odds! INTERSTELLAR is hugely rewarding, considerably
relevant, fearlessly inventive, sensitively thrilling and the best you
can do with the storytelling and technology amalgamation!

Every so often some friends and I get together to watch a movie. When
this film was suggested I wasn't sure what to think, sure I'd seen some
trailers here and there and it looked OK, little did I know this would
be one of the best films I have ever seen! I was lucky enough to see it in Vmax, then the engine was rumbling in a
ship, the cinema shook! it was like a ride from a theme park! the whole
time I was on the edge of my seat, there were very little complaints
when we left. Even Nick, the hater of all things popular, enjoyed it. It was a great sci fi film that I hope will pave the way for more
movies like this!
"

Isn't it so amazing that a movie has got you wondering, thinking and
questioning even days after you have seen it.I don't think I have had this experience ever before until Nolan came
by with Momento....but with Interstellar my thought process is touching
new levels. It makes me wanna see the movie again and again....is
strange though some people here doubt the accuracy of the data shown.
Well guys, this ain't a science documentary but a thought provoking
entertainment flick. So don't miss and re-watch it if you haven't

this movie is complicated and need full concentration to watch,, but
the plot is amazing,if you watch with many people, this movie will let
you have discussion, and makes it more interesting. you should have
good memory because the movie will show past, present and future
condition, also lots of names. Space background make every screen
become unbelievable huge, it's like watching 3 D movie. you can feel a
lot of emotion too, laugh, cry, anger (if you can understand the
story). you can say it's fiction mix with high technology and humanity.
the actors also play characters so brilliant. After all this movie so
well made and need to watch. happy watching

This movie was incredible. Absolutely heart-wrenching. Beautiful in
every single way; cinematography, script, plot, etc. Amazing actors,
amazing cast. I LOVE Matthew McConaughey and Jessica Chastain. I don't
really like Michael Caine but whatever. I do think Jessica Chastain is
one of the best actresses of our time.I do think this movie could have explained a little more, though,
because my lack of knowledge about what was going on sometimes threw me
off. Maybe I was just searching for some kind of legitimate scientific
explanation for what was going on, but they kept on saying it was all
from ""gravity"" and an ""anomaly"" and that didn't totally get through to
me.Also, I get an inkling that they might have done that, and added the
super sensationalist sentimentality towards the end, to get through to
kids and families. Like, they really wanted people to feel something,
and it worked, but at the same time it felt a little silly. Like the
ending was a little odd; Cooper and Murphy meeting and Murphy is old
and Cooper is young. It just felt weird. But all in all, that was
overshadowed by how beautiful and well-done the movie was.The cinematography was just incredible. It had my heart racing from the
very beginning. I had been watching and re-watching the trailers for
this movie over and over and over, and they just had me in tears. I am
such a sucker for epic dramas and lovey-dovey stuff. The sequence when
Cooper was watching his kids videos after he had been stuck on the
planet for all those years killed me. How he just sat there and sobbed
and the lights just flashed over his face while the sound of his kids
voices played. That was just incredible. Definitely one of the best
moments of the movie.The scenes on the first planet were crazy. Extremely believable. This
was SUCH a huge distinction for me. I think any other director would
think to make the planet either really violent and scary or just
ridiculously detailed, but the fact that this planet was just one huge
ocean consisting of one single wave was perfect. Less is so much more.
For the second planet, too. Really incredible. I'm so happy they
weren't filled with aliens or whatever.Also the scene towards the end when Cooper was trying to contact Murphy
through the bookshelves really stuck with me. The whole concept of that
was actually pretty terrifying, and at first when I didn't know what it
was, it freaked me out. It gave off that perfectly disturbing-
uncomfortable feeling just like (I'm sorry, I have to) 2001: A Space
Odyssey. I think it was really well-done. The scene where they were
traveling through the wormhole, too: incredible. Just like how I
imagined traveling through a wormhole would be like. Super freaky,
uncomfortable, like a roller coaster ride through the unknown.Anyway, so yes. I really loved this movie. I'm a sucker for emotional
stuff. It's a great story. It's really full of heart-wrenching things,
beautiful things, and scary things. You will love it.

It's almost impossible to put in words, but we have to try and give
everyone what he truly deserve.In my modest opinion, Interstellar is the best Sci-Fi in human history.
Believe it or not. It's the simple and the complicated, It's the usual
and the different, It's the mind and the heart, It's an emotional and
psychological journey through the unknown which has its own stunning
visuals. It's an original story and thought-provoking masterpiece.Every single time with him, you just got crazy about his ideas,
astonished by his mind games and inspired when he talks to the heart.Back then, he was an ambitious young director. And with his
capabilities made his own way straight through the world. Now, he is an
icon and a legend of directing. He is Christopher Nolan...

Interstellar is the greatest film I have ever seen.I have never seen a movie so successful in its execution, style, and
content. It was emotional without being sappy. It was scientifically accurate
without being too difficult to understand.The story is fascinating.The dialog is beautiful.The music is powerful.The sound is appropriate.The acting is fantastic.The characters are archetypes, but have souls. The future has met the past. This is a film that I feel will never be
surpassed in terms of its quality.And I will fight anyone who tells me otherwise.

what to say where to start from this movie is an absolute epic..A
beautiful SAGA that will live forever in the history of movie
making..our future generations will be jealous of us cause we were
lucky enough to watch it in our lifetimes.. Nolan is just getting
better and better..There is no end to his perfection. with every movie
we feel like he has achieved perfection but next time he amazes us by
achieving even more than what he has done previously.. He is just
raising his bar each time.only 44 years of age & he has already given
us many gems, don't know how many epics he will direct by the time he'l
be 70. What makes me respect him more is his serious dedication to
cinema & to his fans ,he took 10 years to complete INCEPTION's story
and for this he hired KIP Thorne( American theoretical physicist, known
for his contributions in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to
assist him and advise him in the movie. Nothing shown in the movie is
baseless though he has used his imagination very well. Im really amazed
why this movie has got few negative reviews also as i coudnt find a
single loop hole in it,guess people could not digest so much science..i
feel sorry for them that they cant appreciate it. In terms of acting
Academy award winner Mathew mcconaughey has delivered a powerful
performance,he makes u emotional in some sequences & in others makes
you laugh with his good comic timing.he could well be getting a
nomination again this year. Nolan's favorite michael caine is as usual
sublime .then Jessica chastain and Anne hathaway have also suitably
done there jobs. Mackenzie foy who plays young murph's (Mathew
mcconaughey's daughter) role has given a mature performance.she's
really good in the movie. Not to forget Han Zimmer has a big big hand
in making this movie such a phenomena with his music.It is due to his
exhilarating music that you latch yourself with this movie.it really
keeps haunting you hours after you leave the hall.Nolan has got himself
a creative and a legendary musician on his back. Its time for him to
win another academy after the lion king. i waited for this movie as
soon as it was announced cause i had trust on nolan and he has kept it
alive.though difficult but i hope he wins an academy this time cause he
truly deserves after so many years of efforts in direction. wake up
academy he's knocking at the door...;) cant wait for another one ...
love you nolan and zimmer :*

This movie is to prove that love is a physical substance! That was a
shortest summary, but I need to write more lines because otherwise it's
not going to be published)) ""Interstellar"" is a clear poetry of space
exploration and most important things for mankind. This movie is gonna
last! It's like we're reliving golden age of science fiction. Reliving
is a word! Clearly, Nolan is a big fan of Stephen Hawking and it's
pays. I'm already predicting minimum of 3 Oscars for ""Interstellar"". I
hate Matthew McConaughey,he's a poser but in the hands of genius
director, empty bimbo turning into an actor. Visual effects beyond
comprehension, because you'll be thinking they're unessential, but they
feels like real, and this is most important).

Anyways, in terms of the tension of this movie, did you know that every
single piece of ""evidence"" to argue in favor of evolutionism has been
either disproven, or discovered to be fraud? Even an evolutionist has
to admit that fact. The man is﻿ Dr. Kent Hovind and if you watch some
of his videos he will show you where, evolutionists themselves admit
their ""facts"" are false, or at least have been disproven with science.
Evolutionism is not Science as there are no facts to prove it.
Evolution is theory and religion (because you must believe in it) only.
Natural Selection IS a science, but changes are LIMITED within the
animal kinds; all in all, it's not about ""evolution"".

Christopher Nolan has finally cemented his legacy as one of the great
film makers of his generation. Interstellar's strength doesn't lie in
the emotional gravity of its characters nor in the artistic vision it
attempts to portray. Rather, similar to many of Nolan's other films,
Interstellar's strength lies in complex concepts that Nolan so
masterfully incorporates into a thrilling plot and relevant premise. The concept of time is once again revisited and conveyed with the same
craft Nolan displayed in Inception and Memento; an apparent trademark
in his arsenal. The concept of wormholes and quantum physics is
gradually explained to the audience in a comprehensible manner through
the scientists/astronauts/professors. As we begin to understand such
concepts, the movie becomes increasingly gripping as it progresses and
leads to other potential possibilities. All this is underlined by Hans
Zimmer's epic score which is synchronised perfectly with the story.Judging from the reviews of his previous films, Interstellar will
probably draw much debate, especially over the validity of its science.
However such debate will be irrelevant as Nolan probably intended for
the focal point of the movie to be based around the idea of the
transcendence of time.
"

From wormhole to interstellar travel to an Exo-Planet and falling into
a black Hole..Nolan proved himself again. One of the best sci fiction movies
everything was perfect nothing was out of order and Nolan kept it going
all good and all the time lapses. This truly deserves an Oscar. The
ideas are mind blowing and very intelligent characters are best and
acting is cool haven't seen a better science fiction movie which is
explained that correctly. Movie of the year. What more good a science
fiction movie can be. Must watch. Nolan proved himself again. One of

Watched Intersteller.. Its simply an epic... Christopher Nolan again
proved that he is not just a writer or director, actually he is
inventor, scientist. The best ever SIFI movie I watched ever... He just
picked some advance concepts of physics like law of relativity and time
traveling and quantum physics and he invented this movie. When in
interval I stood up and watched people, most of the faces were confused
and silenced. Actually all were confused and trying to understand
actually whats going on in the movie. So before you watch this movie
make sure you at least have some basic info regarding following
terminologies, otherwise movie will be bounced completely:1. Law of relativity 2. WormHole 3. BlackHole 4. Space Time 5. Relative
Time and Time shift 6. What are Dimesions 7. Time is fourth dimension
8. What is time bending and how black hole (gravity) can control and
bend the timeThis is not a ordinary masala, action or entertaining movie but a movie
based on some high level concepts of physics (which yet not proved
practically but theoretically). So if you love masala movie and just
watch movies for entertainment, you not gonna like the movie, it will
be too much bore. The movie goes too slow. Most of the girls not gonna
like this movie. .. This movie deserves academy award.

A complete story of human love and life. The light and the dark. The
near and the far. The struggles we face each day and the love we share.
We, our flaws and the remarkable will, hope and ethics we bear. When
everything we mean tears and breaks to pieces before our very eyes the
impetus of love and life shows us the light.Getting out of the cinema it took me 15 minutes to get my head and
heart right, after which I wanted to get back in there and watch it all
over again!Interstellar was something... it really was... It was like trying to
hold all of humanity in your hands, but it slips like sand between your
fingers, yet you keep trying again and again... and again.

Saw this in IMAX and it is an emotional experience from start to
finish. The robots are kind of dumb looking, but have some nifty
features, including sarcasm. The soundtrack is amazing, but drowns out
some of the dialogue, which is important. Great mindf#@% of a film, if
you just let go of needing to be informed of every little detail.
Everything gets revealed at the end. Sort of sad at the end, but also
leads to a new future. Must see. The special effects are top notch. A
mix of 2001, Contact, Armageddon, and Gravity.I would ignore any review
that rated this movie less than a 5, because even if you wanted to
nitpick everything, you couldn't come up with much. Its a fictional
space and time fantasy with some real physics thrown in.

Not many directors these days have the lofty ambitions Christopher
Nolan possesses. He goes against the grain of Hollywood more so than
any other modern filmmaker. Even his ""Dark Knight"" Trilogy wasn't as
conventional as many would think a super hero movie would be. His
latest endeavor, ""Interstellar,"" pushes Nolan even further into the
realm of exceptional and atypical storytelling.In the near future, Earth is plagued by a blight that is quickly wiping
out all the natural resources left on the planet. Cooper (Matthew
McConaughey) is a former NASA test-pilot and Engineer who took up
farming when the world gave up on space exploration. After stumbling on
to a secret base, he discovers that the supposedly dismantled space
administration has been secretly looking for ways to re-establish
humanity on another planet and save it from extinction. Cooper finds
himself leading a crew of explorers on a perilous exploration beyond
our galaxy for a world we can colonize and begin again on.The best way to describe ""Interstellar"" is as Christopher Nolan's
version of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" for the ADHD generation. Unlike
Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke's 1968 classic, there's a whole
lot more talking and human interaction. The action and drama moves at a
quicker pace as well. The Nolan Brothers wrote the script and knew that
a movie without dialogue that crawled along to its dramatic and
existential climax wouldn't work for today's fast food multiplex
audience.I applaud Nolan for his use of models and other practical effects
versus today's CGI shortcuts. It gives ""Interstellar"" an authentic look
lacking in other science fiction and fantasy films today. The use of
actual sets, locations, and props keeps the audience immersed in the
movie and not constantly anticipating the next overly-synthetic orc or
dragon walking into the scene and pulling you out of the cinematic
experience.One thing that makes me laugh about ""Interstellar"" is the way the
characters refer to the intergalactic entity contacting humanity as
""they."" Not for one moment do the scientists and explorers take into
account that it could be God. After all, the idea of God sending us
messages and leading us anywhere is so much more ridiculous than aliens
from another galaxy.""Interstellar"" is rated PG-13 for some intense perilous action and
brief strong language. Profanity goes beyond the usual expletives and
includes the ""ultimate"" bad word at one point. The movie gets stressful
at points and could give younger (and even older) viewers bouts of
anxiety. Some might also feel a sense of claustrophobia in certain
instances.Although ""Interstellar"" definitely contains some of the very same
concepts and encourages humankind's exploration of space just like
""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" that's where the comparisons end. Christopher
and Jonathan Nolan's story is much more rooted in our sense of
preservation than Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke's complicated
and inexplicable masterpiece. It's a lofty and complex commercial which
urges us to look beyond our own world and regain the sense of wonder
and curiosity we used to have when it came to the Universe that
infinitely surrounds us.
"

Grandiose handling of a simple premise through the sci-fi medium...
Interstellar zips along at a fair pace considering the amount of
dialogue and musings of its characters. Dealing with themes of human
survivability, altruism and abandonment with engaging photography and
ethereal (if sometimes overbearing) sound-scape's the plot is revealed
at a comfortably digestible rate.The special effects are both beautiful yet functional, perfectly
measured to the tonal quality of the scenery and sound. In short they
are ""believeable"" and lend a credibility to the storytelling beyond
that of its Hollywood peers.While many will be intrigued by claims of its intellectual superiority
to other science fiction movies, they will be a little disappointed by
this rarely challenging retelling of a dystopian earth and the
remaining residents search for a new home.Having a Director that is held in such high regard seems to have
elevated Interstellar beyond its counterparts through that virtue alone
which is somewhat unfortunate given that an audience, oblivious to his
previous work, would still enjoy this movie in good measure.That being said, while it may well represent ""the science fiction movie
of the year"" I'm left wondering if in 10 years it will be looked upon
as the sci-fi movie of the decade...something only ""Time"" will tell...

In the near future, Earth's vegetation and plant life has been hit by
'blight'  a disease, infecting the incubation of crops and various
other sources of grown food. A bi-product of which conjures huge
sprawling dust storms, harking back to the ecological devastation of
the 1930's 'dust-bowl'  a whirlwind of dust storms , caused by the
conversion of arid grassland into cultivated cropland during a
decade-long drought. Unfortunately for the people of Earth, 'blight'
consumes much of the free oxygen within the atmosphere, causing not
only starvation from lack of food, but also eventual death by
asphyxiation. In a time where technological innovation and space
exploration are viewed as excessive, no longer necessary and in the
case of the earlier 20th Century Apollo missions  now taught in
schools as propaganda by the Russian's, complete with 'corrected' text
books to support. The struggle to provide food for millions had
ultimately resulted in funding cuts within various technological
fields; and shockingly, even attempts at genocide - we learn the NASA
of old were pressured to drop bombs onto starving people by the Federal
government in order to cull the demand for food  to which they
unashamedly declined and consequently lost their funding and disbanded
as a result.It is here then, that we are introduced to widower; Cooper (Matthew
McConaughey) and his family  daughter Murph, played by the young
Mackenzie Foy, son Tom (Timothée Chalamet); and grandpa Donald (John
Lithgow) - a seemingly dysfunctional but loving, if not slightly
clichéd family, living together in a small farmhouse in middle-
America. Cooper who is struggling to sleep at night, re-living his
nightmarish crash whilst piloting one of the film's iconic 'Ranger'
shuttles for the Air Force in what we presume to be pre-blight era  is
now utilizing his engineering prowess to build and retrofit existing
farming equipment into automated farming machines, gathering corn to
feed his family  expressively unhappy with his current situation and
above all, society's facile view of the world around them, with Cooper
preferring a sanguine view of the human race enduring elsewhere in the
vast Cosmos. His son, Tom is essentially under-performing in school 
pegged as just another (much needed) farmer by his tutor, to which is
counteracted by Daughter; Murph whose intelligence defies her age (10),
often outshining her peers and tutors themselves, and who is infatuated
with theories of science, and what she claims is a ghost or poltergeist
trying to communicate with her through seemingly unexplained phenomena
 a series of gravitational anomalies involving her book case and
settling dust  that initially is refuted by her father, Cooper as
nonsense. It is only when Cooper witnesses this himself; he begins to
investigate, and determines that the aforementioned settling dust is
being manipulated by gravity and represents a pattern of binary code
thus leading him to investigate co-ordinates signified by the
mysterious binary 'message'.The heart of Interstellar is its relationships  whether that be
between Cooper and his daughter, Murph; the relationship between Doctor
Brand (Anne Hathaway) and her father (Michael Caine), or the love that
comes to light mid-mission that would transcend space and time 
literally. Love prevails above all, including rational thought, even in
the most impossible situations. This in itself is not only central to
the story, but also the emotional anchor that connects us as the
audience to the characters, their situation and the impossible
decisions they are forced to make on their mission. There is a
particular moment, as the team arrives at their first destination after
passing through the wormhole where a lapse in judgement by the group
costs them not only the life of a team-mate but also a substantial part
of themselves and their own lives. It's a moment where we, as the
audience can relate; and immediately feel the profound impact and
repercussions of the characters sudden reality  something that Chris
Nolan and co-writer Jonathan Nolan excels at here.It is when the team arrive at their second location (Dr Mann's planet)
that do we truly understand the darker side of the human connection 
here we witness deceit, lies and betrayal as certain aspects of the
mission come to light as 'hopeless' and begin to unravel at a
spectacular rate  both back on Earth and concurrently. Truly a curved
ball to the narrative lies a 'Superstar' cameo with devastating
consequences  Doctor Mann (one of the original twelve individuals from
the earlier Lazarus missions), and the brilliant mind behind the
Lazarus project itself proves that desperation and solitude can have a
profound effect on integrity and judgement - survival instinct is cause
for self-preservation and to push harder to endure indeed.The final act and actions of Cooper and Brand are in many ways, born
out of pure desperation and lack of any other viable options, but also
forged from fulfilling a certain destiny  a brutal, spectacular and
ultimately enlightening perspective on the relevance of black holes and
quantum theory provide a thought provocative and ballsy conclusion to
the conundrum of gravity in the fifth-dimension  remember Murph's
ghost? Fans of Nolan's previous mind-bending effort; Inception will
revel in this.Interstellar then is Sci-Fi at its best, providing a thought-
provocative narrative that continues long after the credits roll. The
audience's individual perception of the ideas and concepts presented
therein will ultimately polarise the audience and divide opinion. This
ultimately boils down to your take on where the science fact ends, and
imagination takes over. I'm firmly of the opinion that this film is
ultimately a journey of entertainment and wonder  it's not a
documentary or even an educational piece - it doesn't even try to be.
Interstellar will certainly widen your perspective and opinion, but it
will also take you on a journey you likely have never experienced
before. Is that not what film is all about?Full, un-edited review available to read online at:

I was pleasantly surprised and pleased with the introductory speech by
director Nolan. This even rose my expectations. You are slowly
introduced to the world not so convenient for humanity anymore. What to
do ? Explore the space and search for new place to live. But it is not
that easy as it seems and appears to be one way journey. This is
thrilling, emotional and exploratory sci-fi. Scenes made with analog
camera are looking great at imax screen. Even story seems good until
last 20 minutes of the movie. There come irrationalities and not so
interesting conclusion. Overall good movie but with disappointing
ending.
"

I cannot contain the excitement I am having now after watching this
film, I saw it yesterday in IMAX (please I recommend you watch this in
IMAX) and it was the first time a movie that did not feel like a movie
when I was watching it. It was as if you are in there and experiencing
it for real, so Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan thank you for
giving us this journey. Each characters felt real to me like this has
already happened and Visual FX by Double Negative is amazing, during
Inception they did a great job but in Interstellar they took it to the
next level. Hans Zimmer has proved himself a maestro again, the score
in every part was excellent and right, I can still hear the score
whenever I think about each scene. Matthew McConaughey did a great job
I hope he gets another Oscar he deserves one for this, Anne Hathway,
Micheal Caine, Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, Matt Damon and
everyone, they were perfect. The only time I realized this was a movie
was when they showed the end credits and I kinda cried inside knowing
this journey has come to an end but I am gonna watch it again because
this just earned my No.1 SCI-FI Adventure movie after 2001:A Space
Odyssey and people if you haven't watched it then stop reading this and
go to your nearest theater and watch this. Please don't miss this
journey cos you'll regret it forever.

2001: A Space Odyssey.. and Gravity.. and Interstellar.. This movie
falls behind those two authentic masterpieces. why? 1) Even though the
storyline is exciting, its too much dragged and lot of exaggerated
philosophy.. 2) existence of 3 planets just near black-hole is crazy
and i am not sure its even possible provided these things existed in
the first place. how is waves existing in 1st planet?? 3)Coop traveling
and surviving through black-hole.. pure pulp fiction..he would have
evaporated in a jiffy..a tesseract built for him.. by humans.. in near
future.. all shown on screen for few minutes.. Nolan.. you need to be
smarter than Inception..but you fall short in execution..Nevertheless this movie needs to be seen and studied if you love
space-time, 5-dimensional world.. etc etc.. Cinematography is
breathtaking.. Overall i didn't feel as emotional as i was after
watching inception.. i mean bottom-line for me is.. this movie shows
flashes of brilliance but no worthy match to the 2 movies i mentioned
before.. Its my opinion..:-)

Interstellar Interstellar Interstellar. Either you gonna love it or
hate it. If you think that Inception was a hard movie to understand ,
wait till you watch Interstellar. If you didn't like Inception then
definitely you are not gonna like Interstellar. Interstellar is
definitely one of the best Sci-Fi movie you will ever see and one of
Mr. Christopher Nolan's masterpieces along with The Dark Knight Trilogy
, Inception and Memento. This movie challenges you and widen your
horizon. If you lack the imagination to believe in the Impossible then
don't go to watch it. That's what I love about Mr. Nolan that he always
challenge his audiences. This Movie has it all ( Drama , Thriller and
Sci-Fi ). All the actors played their role very very well but Matthew
McConaughey was brilliant and convincing not to mention the legendary
Composer Mr. Hans Zimmer who made a wonderful Soundtrack. Mr. Nolan ,
Hans Zimmer , Matthew McConaughey and Michael Caine they don't get
older they only get better. Definitely it will get nominated as Best
Movie , Best Director , Best Composer and Best Actor. FYI I only
understood like 80%-90% of the movie and I am gonna watch it again.
"

Coming from a huge Chris Nolan fan, I am proud to say that Interstellar
has lived up to my expectations. It is the filmmaker's most epic and
emotional piece to date. Zimmer's music score is much different than
his previous masterpieces, a fitting change and one that suits the film
perfectly. The effects are some I have ever seen on screen; watching in
IMAX is a must. The sound mix as exceptional as well. However, this
film is not made for everyone, for example, if you prefer his movies
with more action than drama. Also, it is 3 hours long, so it does
require a lot of available time to watch it through in one sitting. One
of the best movies of 2014.
"
414,10,"
So I got back from watching the movie on the big screen, and I can
honestly say, Interstellar has to be one of the best, if not the best,
movie of 2014, and one of the greatest movies of all time.First off what I really found cool was the special effects. Everything
from the environment to the wormhole visuals was excellently well done.
I also really liked the Lego-legs robots. Like I genuinely felt that I
couldn't tell the difference if it was C.G.I. or actual animation.What I also really admired was the acting. Not one actor felt wooden or
lifeless, I even thought the performance of young Murph was really
good. The best part for me was, like with the title of this review,
everything made sense at the end. Like the execution of the twist in
this movie, how Cooper was the ghost in the beginning, was really
amazing. Overall, definitely worth checking out.
"
415,9,"
I have been watching Nolan's movies since his debut, had a lot of
expectations with this one as each one of them movies stood out from
the rest. I wont say that it fell short any where, but may be the way
it was put,,,, was not right for every audience.It sometimes did feel very very slow,,, For me it was fine but I did
see people walking out of the cinema, may be they were expecting some
action or god knows what. What I have to say is that this movie is not
for everyone, you have to understand how science works and if you
haven't already watched some good old science fiction gig, then you are
going to miss is for sure as it deals with a lot on this.Also, beware, if you are going to take your girlfriend or your wife to
watch this great movie, she might be disappointed....All in all, it was great movie, some nice surprises too :)
"
416,10,"
Another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan . it has got all the
elements we get from Nolan's movies... it got suspense , twists and
emotions . you don't wanna miss a movie a like that . Movie is a bit
slow at the starting but you will get exciting things for every 5min.
The climax connects everything in the movie and you will love it.(
that's what I can say) This is a movie you must watch in theater where
you will have best sound effects and best screen . coming to the
background there are no words for Hans Zimmer . He is the best . Hans
Zimmer and Nolan's is the best combination ever. Don't miss it . watch
it in IMAX
"

First of all, I want to appreciate all the work every person had done
with this movie because we can see such a great quality in every shot.
I want to thank every actor/actress but especially Matthew McConaughey
for being just fantastic. He amazes me all the time. You already
deserve 5 stars from me because of this perfect work.Secondly, I want to talk about the movie itself. Of course, it has such
a great plot! We always wonder what happens in and beyond the galaxy
when we haven't even discovered ourselves. Before I started to watch
the movie I had looked at the rating 8,7 ""Hmm pretty cool!"" but I don't
always trust it so I started to read some reviews. They were amazing
and I was so curious I thought ""This will be the 8th wonder of the
world!""...Well...I liked the movie, it was really good but not that cool.To be
honest, I'm a bit disappointed because I expected it to be at least
""WOW"" but for me it was like ""One more nice movie"". It was a highly-
organized movie but it turned out that my expectations were higher.In conclusion, I leave myself a little hope that it was only my ""fault""
and I wasn't in a right mood to watch this movie. I advise you to watch
it, because if you never try you will never know. Some people like
green apples others like red ones, so..
"
418,7,"
This may probably be my first review over IMDb (even if I'm looking at
reviews and ratings all the time) but I can't let this go:Interstellar may not be the best movie of all times but how the hell
can you be demolishing this movie as you do?This movie brings, which is the main goal of movie, entertainment. If
you want science facts, watch documentaries. If you want SciFi, why
don't you stick to books (intended to make imagination work far beyond
a movie would do) instead of watching a movie?This movie brought me, during a bit more than two and a half hours, in
deep space and time. It even worked so fine I didn't even notice it was
so long.I was totally convinced by this movie even though I noticed the
gigantic, not to say cosmic, plot holes (the NASA stuff, the main
attitude of Matthew McConaughey and so on). But at least, it made the
job: it ENTERTAINED me and brought a little magic with this cocktail of
space travel and time.But I can't stand reading these completely unjustified negative reviews
made against a movie that sincerely does not deserve such hate. I'm
wondering if, as complained for very positive reviews over-rating the
movie as a marketing plot, the main goal is to lower down this movie to
keep others on the top.Interstellar is, again, not a masterpiece but totally worth watching
for those who'd like shipping through space (not to say dreams) for 3
hours.
"
419,10,"
Let's start like this: If Sandra Bullock can get nominated for ""Best
Actress"" for Gravity, and if Alfonso Cuaron can get nominated for ""Best
Director"" for Gravity (then actually win it), and if Gravity can itself
get nominated for ""Best Motion Picture"" together with so many other
so-called ""Oscar"" nominations, then why the heck should Interstellar be
left desolate? What is the jury trying to prove, that Nolan can suck it
up, that however incandescent he comes up in every other project, he'll
still be entertained with comments on obsession and insanity? I mean
look at IS's script once for god's sake (I'm really starting to doubt
the ""god"" part here.) Nolan literally infuses the most divine elements
of time and cosmology with compassion, stress, and culminates at
cyclical pointsthere is no end; you can't tell what part of the movie
you liked most. I read some reviews on Interstellar stating that the film can be
compared to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Are you serious? It's not like I'm
blindly in love with this guy but Nolan is far more prodigious than
Stanley Kubrick. That guy was a mastermind and surely far ahead of his
time, but Nolan, don't ask me, Nolan doesn't know what time is, because
once you know time, you have to conform to it, and that is ""friction""
to apotheosis. Interstellar is something that is not directed towards mass audience;
it's engendered only for those who have this innate sensibility and
passion for assimilation, who are genuinely dissatisfied with the
regular course of life and seek exploration, and who are simply
""non-conformists"". The movie isn't a sci-fi, although this view is
relative. It builds itself on that premise but it indicates and
enforces concepts of love, family, nostalgia, care-taking, and acute
improvisations. The plot is not simple at all; that's why I'm saying
this movie is not for everybody. If you're a professional critic, or a
dilettante, sure, go ahead, but if you wish to see it only because your
dad keeps your pockets filled, back off. As an advocate of philosophy, I'm not usually very keen to make
empirical comparisons and judgments. But here, I think they're really
necessary. Gravity (2013) was nominated for ten Oscar nominations. I'm
sure as hell I loved that movie but now that I've seen Interstellar,
Gravity seems so incompetent to me now. Why isn't Nolan nominated for
direction? Where's the ""Best Original Screenplay"" nomination? Where's
the ""Best Picture"" nomination? I'm ready to compromise on
cinematography and best actor (Matthew McConaughey pulled off an
intense performance, but still, you know, you can't get everything) but
the rest is utterly unequivocal. The way Nolan has produced and
directed movies throughout his career, I don't think anybody else can
ever pull out projects with this much vigor. I'm sure Nolan isn't
materialistic, else he would have committed suicide by now, but come
on, he must be credited with things other than praises and complements.
I mean who actually goes to NASA, Space X, takes courses on
""relativity"" from California Institute of Technology, and consults
physicists? Justify his endeavors god dammit. The script is something like this. In a world with imminent collapse, a
former pilot agrees on a venture in collaboration with NASA to travel
through the wormhole in search for other planets with ""survival""
ingredients. That's the synopsis. Now let's move forward in ""time"" and
see Cooper in the black hole in ""extra-dimension"" where he witnesses
his daughter's experiences (most of them with past-Cooper) in response
to messages sent by the future-him. That's how mankind's survival is
ensured, through an unlimited odyssey into stakes and gorges, and
through devising solutions through incessant painstaking, and
humanitarianism. Nolan isn't just a director, writer, or producer, he
is a philanthropist. He is the unhatched egg to perfectionism. Too bad,
the old-fashioned assessors nominating and awarding mostly the ""lamest""
movies of the year are too ignorant to appreciate aesthetes and
aesthetics.
"
420,10,"
This movie is probably the closest to perfect ever made. Chris Nolan
never ceases to amaze, with his movies getting better and better one
after the other. Interstellar has all the hallmarks of a good movie :
great acting, spectacular visuals and even a great soundtrack that
blends in well with the entire movie. Although the concept can be
pretty hard to grasp, Nolan has done sufficient research, and has
managed to lay out the concept professionally. The movie has a fair
share of everything: action, romance, comedy and even showcases a
strong father-daughter relationship. The movie lasts about 3 hours, but
it is guaranteed that you would not notice the time pass by as this
movie will keep you interested, and it is definitely worth all your
time and money. Not watching this movie is a huge loss.
"
421,9,"
There's no denying the visceral power and prowess of Christopher
Nolan's Intersellar. The ninth film from the popular director is his
most ambitious, and it looks jaw-droppingly gorgeous. The sets,
miniatures, and images of space travel and planets all combine to make
a film the scope of which rivals any other space movie.Emotionally, the film comes close to achieving a similarly momentous
effect. Interstellar follows Coop (Matthew McConaughey), a father
forced to leave his family in a possibly mad attempt to preserve the
future of humanity by finding another habitable planet. The tale is
filled with drama, humor, intense action and surprising plot twists.
There's rarely a dull moment in the movie because the story is so
compelling and poignant.But maybe it's all a bit too much. The script, by Nolan and his brother
Jonathan, packs ideas and theories in every single scene. Concepts
about love, survival, physics, and time burst from the film more
prominently than the emotion and visuals. Even with a nearly three-
hour runtime, so many ideas are presented that the film rarely has time
to focus on one over another. The result is a technical marvel with a
powerful narrative that ends up feeling a tad empty because we aren't
sure exactly which point it's trying to make.One of the best things about Interstellar is the manner in which it
distinguishes itself from every other space movie. There's no big
training sequence, the shuttle take off sequence is truncated, we don't
get to space for 40 minutes of screen time. Right off the bat Nolan
tells us we're going to see something different. Then once in space
(which is where the majority of the movie takes place), everything gets
bigger. He's not interested in our solar system. Nolan is interested in
something far beyond it.In the same way Intersellar attempts to stand out as a sci-fi film, it
works to distinguish itself from a dramatic angle. On its own the story
is direct, with good dramatic tension. Clear goals are presented, then
attempted, and then either met or failed leading into the next scene.
Anything you may think doesn't match up or feels superfluous eventually
pays off in a pretty solid way. Sure there's a misstep here or there,
but at its core, Interstellar is always interesting.One of the biggest complaints in Nolan's earlier films is they rarely
include rich female characters. This film has two of them, Coop's
colleague Brand, played by Anne Hathaway, and the grown up version of
his daughter Murph, played by Jessica Chastain. Each represents a step
forward for Nolan as they're well-written and strong characters.
Unfortunately, the relationships they develop are much weaker. The
relationship between father and daughter Coop and Murph is a strained
and incomplete one, but that's demanded by the narrative. Coop and
Brand also have a bit of a budding connection which becomes
increasingly important as the film goes along. However, it feels like
an afterthought as it's casually dropped in with a few short lines of
dialogue and then hardly developed.Then, just when you start to scratch your head about Interstellar, it
sucks you back in with its intense action scenes. They're few and far
between but when they happen, you'll be glued to your seat. By taking
his time to flesh out the story, Nolan earns lots of good will and you
never quote know what's going to happen. There are at least two big
turns later in the movie that really keep you on your toes and divert
from some other issues.Issues such as the fact he's provided so many different narrative
strings and questions, he's forced into some convenient narrative
choices near the conclusion. These pay off emotionally but when
everything else in the film has been pushing toward unpredictability
and originality, they're a little disappointing, albeit understandable.McConaughey has a lot of heavy lifting to do in Interstellar and he
does it well. Obviously he's dynamic, charming and confident, but the
real surprise is how he hits all the big dramatic peaks and valleys.
Hathaway is steadfast with her limited role and Chastain, in an even
more limited role, makes Murph the real star of the movie. She's a
force to be reckoned with, infusing multiple layers into the few scenes
she has.As Interstellar ends, there's no doubt you've been on a ride. A
thoroughly enjoyable and memorable cinematic experience that's well-
made and acted. On those notes, Nolan totally succeeds. Afterwards
though, you'll be more inclined to talk about the actions scenes and
narrative twists rather than the multitude of themes he's placed
throughout the film. That's because it's just too much to talk about.
What does love mean? How do we handle time? What does it mean to
survive? Is it okay to offer hope when there is none? The film's
questions are endless and overwhelming.Which leads to one last question, do we care? That's a something you'll
have to decide. Interstellar is a good film with big flaws that may or
may not matter because everything around them is done so well./Film rating: 9.5 out 10
"
422,10,"
This is the best movie I've seen till now. The way Nolan has portrayed
the Black hole and event horizon theory is just truly amazing and
incredible. Having set out to be a journey into what can hardly be
depicted at all, Interstellar must find oblique ways of suggesting
further imperceptible dimensions of the real. A combination of
spectacular special effects, marginal physics and grindingly slow
treacle, McConaughey pulls this one out of the fire. It is worth the
journey to see what Nolan has constructed as a model of the unknowable.
Interstellar may be a preposterous epic, but it is an epic nonetheless.
Watching this movie in a Theater was an amazing experience for me. Well
done Nolan and Mathew, movie was awesome.
"
423,10,"
Let me make it clear to my reader, I do not possess the energy, will,
or confidence to create a review, yet I have done so solely for the
purpose of making sure every single human being that looks for reviews
on this movie, sees the truth. I had been looking forward to this movie
ever since I saw the trailer for it, perhaps even before that. Being a
big fan of Nolan, I couldn't wait to see what he had in store for us. In this adventure, that, in my opinion only Nolan could capture so
magnificently, Earth had a sort of economical/agricultural crash.
Society is expected to focus their attention on farming. Crops seem to
now die out and one of the basic motivators of the plot, is that corn
is the only crop we have left, and even that is getting ready to die
out. Cooper, portrayed by McConaughey, is an ex-NASA pilot that is
unsatisfied with the world that he is placed in. It's evident that his
only connections to this science-lacking planet, are his children. When
he learns that NASA is searching for life on other planets and needs
his help, he has no other choice then to go. Cooper's travel through
space turns out to be a lot more than just searching for another planet
to live on.I watched Interstellar on vacation with my family one day, the next day
after I drove home, I went to the theater again. An epic film like this
needs to be understood as fully as possible. Interstellar is a movie
that dives into the unknown. It's an overall positive film that poses
the question, what are we going to truly accomplish in the future?
Nolan begins to answer this with Interstellar but in reality, he wants
his audience to answer for themselves. People who think this movie is
boring and long-winded, haven't the maturity or intelligence to
understand it and I encourage them to broaden their horizons. To those
who think this movie was scientifically inaccurate, Kip Thorne, the
executive producer and real-life astrophysicist talks about his
involvement in the film in multiple interviews that prove it's
legitimacy. It needs to be understood that many of the occurrences that
take place in Interstellar haven't yet been attempted, making them
theories, yet possible theories. Ice on Dr. Mann's planet not being
sturdy enough to support the natural structures was said to be the
biggest flaw in the film. If you have seen the film already, you'll
realize this is not a big flaw. All in all, this film requires you to think, and believe. And I believe
that this movie should be seen by every person able to. I am hopeful
that this review will persuade you to ignore the negativity placed on
this movie. Trust me when I say, Interstellar will surprise, induce,
and inspire. Thank you for your time.

When I first read about Chris Nolan making a sci-fi space travel movie,
I was a bit skeptical, whether Nolan could give Ridley Scott,
Spielberg, Cameron and the great Kubrick a run for their money?
Although after seeing the Batman trilogy, The Prestige, Memento and
Inception, I was convinced that he is one of the finest storytellers in
cinema. And from the first look of the movie months before it's
scheduled release on 7th Nov 2014, I honestly found the glimpse of
Interstellar somewhat mediocre (probably coz it didn't give out too
much and the secrecy being maintained for long regarding the plot of
the movie)But then, when subsequent trailers came out giving teases of other
worlds, story of a father (Cooper) embarking on a voyage to save
mankind from it's end and a memorable quote 'love is the one thing that
transcends time and space' , I was kind of convinced that this will be
unlike any other sci-fi space movie we have seen before.So when the reviews came out, they were generally positive, but not
perfect (the kind that Inception got, and was the talk of the town and
back then), since I had personally expected it to be Nolan's best work
to-date.Because of busy work schedules, I ended up watching the movie a little
late than most other friends. But after witnessing the spectacle, I was
completely blown away. So my actual review begins here - It starts up with the story mainly
comprising of Cooper and Murphy, which is very well acted by Matthew
and Mackenzie Foy. The scene where Cooper drives off after bidding
farewell to Murphy for his voyage (which was also seen in the trailer)
gives you a lump in the throat. When the journey to discover other
worlds begins, it's something really extraordinary and I was left
speechless. Interstellar somewhat refreshed my memories from Gravity
and 2001: A Space Odyssey as well. Interstellar is at about 150
minutes, but the second half completely immerses you in the journey
with the Endurance(the name of the space ship) and in IMAX it
definitely made me feel into space. I wouldn't want to give away too
much to people who have not seen it yet, but trust me on this one - the
story, the acting and the special effects blend perfectly well to give
us undoubtedly one of the best space movies ever made.The simple reason this is one of the greatest films ever made is
because it will stay with you forever.10 out of 10 for Interstellar.

Cool movie ever, another excellent credit for Christoper Nolan
masterpiece, this movie was great in any point of view, we can also
learn science and relativity theory from this movie.. just one word for
this movie : AMAZING !! Christoper Nolan brought us to the real another
galaxy, we can feel the fear, we can feel the emotions and we also feel
the meaning of becoming human.. Although I think that this movie need
more comprehension especially in the science fact about black hole,
relativity , and about time I suggested before watching this movie, you
should understand about relativity theory and black hole, you don't
have to be nerd in quantum physic but maybe just a little understanding
in it, and if you already watch this movie before understand all about
that Einstein's Theory, this movie was still great and the camera
brought us become the first person's point of view.. That was so cool
and that movie make me interest to study about time,space and
relativity just like a nerd :) thankyou Christoper Nolan, I think you
are not an ordinary human

Interstellar is an instant classic. Nolan goes far and beyond any of
his past films in terms of ambition and originality. The visuals in this movie are indescribable, the scenes in space are
something that all moviegoers should get a chance to experience. In the
movie Gravity, although the shots were beautiful, you never got to
experience travel throughout space the way that Interstellar is able to
produce. There was a distinct silence in the movie theater while the
space sequences were taking place; it's pretty hard not to be in awe at
what Nolan is able to create (without using any green screens keep in
mind)The acting across the board was very well done. Mcconaughey stands out
though, without his stability in this performance Interstellar just
wouldn't have been the same. I was discussing with my friends trying to
think of another actor who could have fit the role that he played, not
many names came up. Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Wes Bentley, Casey
Affleck, and especially Jessica Chastain do their part in creating an
extremely strong supporting cast. My original expectations for this movie was that I was going to be
taken on an epic journey to space. Those expectations were exceeded
with many twists that I didn't see coming, a beautiful and calming
score by Hans Zimmer, and to top it off it is a movie that makes you
think and discuss ideas with your friends. There are some minor problems with the movie: The run time drags on a
bit although everything in the movie is very important, there are some
parts that can be taken as being hokey, it is also easy to get lost
with exactly what is going on which is why I would suggest to see this
movie more than once (for me it gets better each time)This movie does not reach perfection, but it does reach for the stars.
It is Nolan doing what he does best on his grandest scale to date.
"

I've seen this movie 2 times, once in a theater and once in iMax. I'm
thinking about seeing it again in theater. This movie is easily one of
the greatest movies I've ever seen, it's beautiful, emotional and
inspiring. It expands my mind every time I watch it, and the sound
track is simply wondrous. If you haven't seen this movie, you need to.
I'm not a very emotional person, but this movie opens me up every time
I watch it, it is a milestone for all movies. Christopher Nolan never
disappoints when it comes to his directorial work, I am hoping he plans
to continue the story of Interstellar in some form.Do yourself a favor and see this movie, you won't be disappointed
whatsoever.
"
428,10,"
There are so many reviews already on ""Interstellar"" that I will leave
it at just my own emotional reaction. In the first half hour or so my
heart was sinking because the character and story development are very
slow. This is not an action movie. As the main story builds though, the
emotional content also builds. In the final analysis, this is a movie
about humanity, and maybe more emotional than many a love story or
other tearjerker. The second half of the movie is both riveting on the
plot level, and emotionally intense. It has something of ""2001 Space
Odyssey"", it has something of ""Gravity"", and yet: it is more
emotionally complete than ""2001"" and more emotionally real, and
relevant, than ""Gravity"". I can see how it may not be for everyone. But
it worked for me. And thankfully we are spared many of the tried and
true end of the world tropes. No finger wagging here. In fact there is
a nod and twinkle to science and against anti-science and romantic back
to the roots forces. In its basic premise it is therefore much more
modernist - in the space age fashion of the 1950s and 60s - than other
current sci fi. Modernist, optimist, yet not triumphalist. It really
pulled it off to navigate clear from cliché most of the time.

I've seen Interstellar in the cinema three times already and it gets
better and better every time I see it! People who disliked the movie
usually are the ones who didn't understand what it was about. The
acting is superb, the visuals are jaw dropping especially on 70mm or
IMAX. (Haven't seen the IMAX version yet unfortunately, but the 70mm
was a treat). The music is also a perfect fit for the movies
atmosphere, Hans Zimmer did a great job there! Everyone seems to
compare Interstellar with Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey, well
do not! They're two completely different movies even tho they're both
categorized in the Sci-fi genre. In my humble opinion Interstellar is a
much better executed film, hands down. There is no comparison!
"

First of all I want to remind that this movie is completely different
from any previous Nolan movie I've seen, exception for a few solutions
of storytelling Nolan uses frequently.Nolan himself admitted this movie is inspired both by Tarkovskij's
Mirror and Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey, and I must say that last
title's influence is very evident throughout the entire movie, full
with references, without that downgrading this movie at all. I saw
myself some references in Solaris (1972) too. The movie, if you didn't
expect, is a slow movie. it has some deep messages, most of which told
by the characters, and has incredibly well done visual effects. Each actor's performance was great, starting from McConaughney, Jessica
Chastain and Michael Caine, to Matt Damon's cameo, strangely uncredited
though of its own importance in the movie. The music of Hans Zimmer surprised me completely, even though was said
to be original and new. It has nothing to do with Zimmer's previous
scores, and in certain points reminds of 2001: A space odyssey.I can see, strangely, how this movie's direction was originally thought
to be given to Spielberg; certain scenes give that thrilling fear that
Spielberg uses in his own movies, though storytelling and the way the
entire film is shot does not resemble Spielberg's way of direction at
all.I come back to the visual effects. They were stunning, just as the
ideas and concepts that have been put in this movie. This movie, as I
already said, is very clearly inspired by 2001, but is less enigmatic
and maybe more adapted to present audiences. It does have more science
than 2001, more deepness of the message than 2001, and, to me, it's
what 2001 should have been, not taking away respect to the movie that
is considered by me the founder of the Science Fiction as a true,
modern cinematic genre. I'd give a 11/10 to this movie if I only
could!!!
"

First of all, I am love all movie genres, from Rom Com to Sci Fi. So,
frankly speaking I don't judge a movie by it's Genre. I have seen a
huge number of Sci Fi movies including the 2001: A space Odyssey. I
tell you this is going to be treated a masterpiece from now on. I am
deeply interested in subjects of deep space, wormhole, distant galaxy,
black hole etc. and Intersteller has got everything I needed in a Sci
Fi movie. It's like a dream come true to me. The story is wonderful and
the drama was brilliant. Being a father of a daughter, some moments
almost got my eyes moist. Intersteller is going to be a milestone in
Sci Fi genre from now on.

I saw this film in IMAX 70mm which was a true visual experience you can
nowhere see and thats why I think this movie should be watched on big
screens. Some of the reviewers here are too much over-thinking about
the movie - plot and scientific facts. Yes it contains more fiction
then science but the purpose of film makers is not to deliver
scientific accurate documents. I really enjoyed the film from the first
second to the end and was never thinking about how long this movie is.
There are very few films for me which literally suck you right into the
movie and release you at the end and this is one of it. p.s.: for hardcore sci-fi fans (which I'm) - this is not attempt to
create another sci-fi art / Kubrick clone - be prepared for not
accurate science and just enjoy the movie as is.
"
433,10,"
Given how much Hollywood has been obsessed with mega-budget
blockbusters based on comic books or franchise films in the 21st
century, it is sometimes easy to forget that certain films of other
genres, made on roughly the same budgets can have an impact as well.
British director Christopher Nolan's immense and philosophical 2014
science fiction epic INTERSTELLAR is just one such film. It is a film
that, much like 1997's CONTACT and 2013's GRAVITY, owes a significant
story debt to director Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001:
A SPACE ODYSSEY, a debt that Nolan himself freely acknowledges Set in
some unknown, far-flung future in which life on Earth is becoming
increasingly uninhabitable due to out of control climate chaos, and
where massive dust storms are commonplace, the film stars Matthew
McConaughey as the chosen leader of an expedition to find new habitats
for what's left of Earth's population in the vast reaches of outer
space. But to do that, they will have to venture through a black hole
that opened up within our own Solar System, around Saturn. They make
that ultra-hazardous journey through the black hole, and find three
worlds spinning along the vortex, one of which may very well support
human life, and another one of which they find a survivor (Matt Damon)
of a previous expedition. They are then confronted with the issues of
the space-time continuum that was part of Albert Einstein's theory of
relativity; and McConaughey is confronted with having left his family
behind to face the apocalyptic devastation that he knows awaits him if
and when he should return from the far-flung reaches of the universe.
But following another trip through the black hole, McConaughey is in
for an extremely big surprise, one as much inspired by The Twilight
Zone as anything else.Nolan, whose credits include such comic-book smashes as THE DARK KNIGHT
and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, as well as psychological thrillers like
MEMENTO and INCEPTION, set himself an enormous task in making
INTERSTELLAR. In a movie business so overrun with mega-budget movies
with lots of CGI special effects, plenty of explosions, over-the-top
stunts, and way over-the-top violence, all of which are supposedly
""sure things"", he took an extreme risk by expending close to $150
million on a fantastic sci-fi opus that touches on genuine human,
psychological, and philosophical concerns for the future of mankind.
But as Kubrick, one of Nolan's favorite filmmakers, once observed,
nothing is as dangerous as a ""sure thing""; and in making INTERSTELLAR
the way he has, along with co-writing the screenplay and largely
eschewing CGI for more traditional special effects work, some of which
had been seen in CONTACT, he has sought to make his concerns every bit
as real as humanly possible, and attempted, more than a little
successfully, to follow in the footsteps of ""2001"" in showing us the
possibilities of where Man was going in the universe, and his ultimate
place in the cosmos. He has managed to do this in a film that runs
slightly under three hours, or about thirty-five minutes longer than
even the lengthy and stately Kubrick masterpiece. This will invariably
try a lot of audience members' patience, but the truth is that not
every film needs to be reduced to childish lowest common denominator
simplicity to be very good.Even with so visual a story that INTERSTELLAR has, Nolan hasn't
forgotten that people power films as much as the technicians; and
having seasoned actors like McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, and Anne
Hathaway, and veterans like Michael Caine and John Lithgow, in the cast
is certainly something to be proud of. The scenes of the dust storms
ravaging McConaughey's home farm in the opening section of the film are
frighteningly impressive; and the passage that McConaughey's ship
""Endurance ""takes through the black hole have some of the mythical
quality of the Star Gate in ""2001"", and similar ones in STAR TREK: THE
MOTION PICTURE and CONTACT.The keyboards/synthesizers/organ score by Hans Zimmer, who is one of
the most prominent composers in film music in Hollywood during the 21st
century, does a lot to enhance the immensity and the scope of
INTERSTELLAR, as Steven Price's did for GRAVITY. And while it is easy
to get wrapped up in the IMAX sound and the visuals of the piece, in
the end the overwhelming sense to be gotten out of INTERSTELLAR is,
like Kubrick and ""2001"", a genuine concern for not only film as Art,
but the future of Man in the cosmos. That by itself sets it apart from
a lot of Hollywood films of the 21st century.And in the final analysis, all of those things make INTERSTELLAR easily
one of the best films of 2014.

Well, I probably never write any reviews but this time just for
Interstellar I'm gonna write a review. Christopher Nolan has directed
this movie perfectly and very awesome work done by him and his complete
team. This movie is my first Sci-Fi movie that I've watched and I was
so pleased with this movie that I don't have any words to describe this
movie. Matthew McConaughey has played a perfect role as well but the
most beautiful thing about this movie that I liked the most apart from
the whole space thing was a relationship of Father-Daughter between
Cooper and Murph! It was portrayed very beautifully and emotionally.
This movie is a total blend of Sci-Fi and emotions. Great work done
Christopher Nolan! A 10 star for your movie and I can say this is the
movie of the year 2014! Brilliant work! I can watch this movie 100
times! Good job and Hats Off!
"

This is a rich, satisfying and gripping epic with several interwoven
themes: father-daughter relationships, ecological collapse, survival,
interstellar travel, alien worlds and more. The space scenes are
beautiful, especially the worm hole, black hole and alien worlds.Matthew McConaughey is the emotional heart of the film, and he pulls it
off beautifully (like the fine actor we all now know he is). I was
deeply moved by a few of the father-daughter scenes. Anne Hathaway and
the others were also good.OK, there were several aspects of the movie that did not feel quite
right to me. They were jarring, and caused me to question what I was
watching. Moreover, I can't say I liked the far-fetched deus-ex-machina
ending. But, hey, what do I know about worm holes, event horizons, the
fifth dimension and tesseracts. At times, this movie did feel somewhat
like other space movies that have been made over the years. Having said
this, these problems didn't ruin the movie for me, which I think is
worth about 8.5 out of 10. The movie is almost three hours long, but it didn't feel tedious.
"
436,10,"
This is the best film I have ever seen, how others can give it less
than 9 is beyond me. Yes it may not be factually correct but please
remember it is a FILM. For enjoyment. This film is truly incredible,
mind blowing and heart wrenching. I cry at a lot of films but I have
never cried like I did for Interstellar. Christopher Nolan is an
outstanding director, this film has left a lasting impression on me. I
left the cinema in shock at how incredible it is. I had to write a
review because it so deserves it. It deserves 10/10 I cannot fault it.
Everyone needs to see this film to really understand how incredible it
is. Please keep voting this highly, it deserves to be at the top and
really deserves all the recognition it can get. The best film I have
seen, and will ever see.
"
437,7,"
I'm a big fan of Nolan ever since Memento, but this movie falls short
of the high standards Nolan has set for himself. Black holes play an
important role in this movie so be prepared to just nod your head and
go along with the ""science"" being explained. I'm no physicist but I'm
pretty sure black holes don't behave the way they are depicted in the
film. The climax of the film is where things went downhill for me.Go to the film for the powerful performances given by the cast. Even if
you shake your head at science component of the film there is no
denying the emotion of the film and the final frames certainly tug at
your heart strings. The visuals are also excellent, but not
exceptional. An above average effort but probably Nolan's most
""disappointing"" film to date.
"
438,10,"
I saw this movie the Friday it came out. Since it was close to three
hours long, I went to a dine-in theater. I suspected it would be good,
but I walked out of that theater amazed. Where to begin. I suppose at
the end, because that is what I remember the best. It felt like it was
a tad bit rushed, probably due to Nolan not wanting to make it even
longer than it was. However, it still ended well and was very
thought-provoking. The one thing that made me mad was how they killed
off basically every astronaut besides the two main ones. It seems like
those are the only people who survive in these kinds of movies now.
(Granted that, I can't seem to think of a movie that managed to weave
the end-of-the-world storyline like this one). I didn't even know Matt
Damon was going to be in the movie, which was a pleasant surprise,
until he killed another astronaut, tried to kill Cooper (McConaughey),
and ended up killing himself trying to dock. Yea, he did that. Anyway,
the exposition also was one of the best parts, I think. It showed what
the Earth was like now, set up the characters, and provided some good
humorous parts (the whole parent-teacher conference thing). The visual
effects were amazing, the sound was okay (but everything else makes up
for it), and the acting was also very good. I personally like Doyle,
but I saw his death coming (he had ""red shirt"" written all over him.
The last thing I want to say is I like how they incorporated the whole
black-hole scene. For a minute or so I thought it had went completely
supernatural, which disappointed me, until I realized what was really
going on and I now consider it probably one of the best scenes in the
movie. All in all, I think that Nolan managed to create an excellent
movie with Interstellar.
"

Whats been showed in interstellar really blew my mind, especially the
part when they enter the black hole, seeing a 5th dimensional space was
very interesting and mind bending and i think the people that worked on
the movie really did a great job with the hole movie.When they went to the first planet with the huge waves that time passed
at a much higher rate because of the difference in gravity was very
intense, when they got back to the ship in orbit and went to check on
messages from earth, Cooper was watching the video messages from his
daughter that had grown much older within just hours for him, watching
the messages with her growing before his eyes and seeing his reaction
was very heart breaking and very intense.Movie Recommended!

As a drama movie lover, Interstellar strikes me hard and deep and
resonates with me for a long time. It has profound lingering effect on
me after I watched it the 1st time. It is very worthwhile experience to
me trying to dig into each character's mind and feel their emotion in
the journey. Although at the first glance Interstellar may look like a
""sci-fi movie"", the deeper meaning that it really try to convey may
only be revealed once the outer scientific layer was proficiently
translated, which may be easier for viewers with related physics
background. Just like a professor who taught electromagnetic field
theory facilitated me to appreciate the beauty of physics by getting
through the Maxwell equation outer layer. :)In the beginning of the film, the deep relation and emotion among
characters has been built up with good foundation, which is the heart
of this movie. And the interesting clue for the later hyper- dimension
travel was also hidden there. As the journey unfold, the relationship
bounds among characters got actually stronger even with astronomically
increasing ""distance"" in both spatial and temporal domain, the bound
can even be built crossing the human-machine interface (TARS & CASE).
The consequence of distorted originally- linear-space-and-time concept
adds in additional twist in the drama and keep the audiences in tension
all the time.If the relationship is the heart of the movie, the soundtrack is the
soul of Interstellar. The lingering sadness with curiosity to the
unknown was overflown in the entire theme. Many unforgettable scenes
were greatly amplified and engraved in audience's feeling with Zimmer's
emotional score, such as ""Mountain"", ""Coward"", ""No Time for Caution"",
and especially ""Detach"". The ""Detach"" scene and music is probably the
mostly emotionally unforgettable part of this movie to me, while ""No
Time for Caution"" is the most intense one. It is amazingly experience
to listen to these scores with good audio system that can provide
profound sub- bass.The Tesseract scene trying to complete the circle of the beginning
mystery. While it is interesting to use gravity to propagate
information across hyperspace, it may be a little bit cheesy. It does
provide a intriguing cause to further draw the audience into the black
hole to explore the Hyperspace travel. An interesting read,
""Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time
Warps, and the 10th Dimension"" may deepen your interest on this topic.
Being a EM field theory guy, I found it very interesting.The ending of Cooper heading for Amelia on the finally habitable planet
is a nice touch. It matches perfectly with the gravitational time
dilation and gives hope to the audience, which I love most.
Interstellar give me not only a beautiful drama, amazing soundtrack,
and even a life-long interest in the hyperspace and unified field
theory. How much more can you ask for from a ""sci-fi movie""?

Just made an account here just to say that i loved this movie so much!
It must be one of the best science fiction movies ever and this is my
best 2014 movie.If you are a science fiction fan or just an open minded person then you
will love this movie! It had everything in it! It kept me on for the
whole movie. Actually i see no reason why someone would hate this movie
, maybe if you are kind of religious fanatic type of person.The movie is based on exploration mostly and this is what you don't see
on today movies very often , actually it is very rare. I loved this
movie and everyone should give it a shot!
"
442,10,"
OK after a very long waiting for the blu-ray today i watched the movie.
First of all i'll guarantee you that this is a MUST WATCH movie for
Sci-Fi lovers. The runtime is long and someone can think this is boring
but i must tell you that watch this movie till the end. actually i can
say that its a journey that you feel to the core. all the credits must
go for the plot and the best director. like all of them said the plot
is completely pure. also must say that Hans Zimmer done a fantastic job
all over the movie. and with a pure plot and Nolan's directing + Hans
Zimmers music it's a high class weapon that can attack you heavily.
Christopher Nolan this movie showed us what you can do. and its very
clear that you made your life IMMORTAL.

Inception, till now was the best Nolan movie for me but Interstellar
just sets his standards so high. A truly wonderful experience of 2014.From character selection to direction, everything is perfect in every
hell manner. The movie has an amazing original plot which is somewhat
complex yet deeply emotional and just so satisfying. Interstellar is I
guess the only Nolan movie with such a superior emotional punch and
this movie can make you cry on some scenes. Precise science and facts
are utilized in the movie. It may be a little complex to understand for
a few people yet in the end, you got to do some research. Talking about Visual Effects and music, Interstellar has to snatch
Oscars in these two categories. The VFX team has put a whole lot of
hard work in achieving this level of superiority. For music and
background score, do I need to describe it, guys it's Hans Zimmer. The
background score is very deep and intense just like it was in
inception.Performances were pretty good especially by Matthew McConaughey. The
other characters also do well. Wrapping it up, it might not be the best movie for 2014 for me yet it
will surely be on the top 5's.
"
444,10,"
Simply put, watching this movie was one of the strongest experiences of
my life. I would recommend it to anyone, especially if you like your
mind to travel in the zone between ""strange"" and ""amazed"" (and beyond).I would like to end my review here, because I think the rest is for you
to explore, unspoilt, but since there's a minimum review length, I will
go on to say that the music is as strong an experience as the rest. And
for those of you doubting, one of the movie's executive producers was
Kip Thorne, a theoretical physicist, which means the theories put
forward in the movie are pretty accurate (though of course the movie
explores theories beyond current knowledge). AFTER having seen the
movie, you should watch Neil Degrasse Tyson's 15 minute interview,
about the science behind Interstellar.
"
445,10,"
To simply put it. A Masterpiece.... Nolan never fails to rejuvenate me.
All the things we have studied in the past about space and galaxy has
been flawlessly simulated in the movie. His execution in creating such
a difficult concept has been immensely outstanding. I promise that you
will forget where you are and get carried away in some other dimension
as portrayed by the movie. Its both mesmerizing as well as promising
which will put you on the edge of your seat for sure. Interstellar will
take you surfing in the space and probably in some other galaxy. There
have been many attempts to create such sci-fi films, but this takes
away the cake.
"
446,10,"
I went into the movie theatre ready for whatever Christopher Nolan
decided to throw at me, I was sceptical but also anxious in
anticipation since his movies so far have been hit and miss with some
exceptional masterpieces but also some so and so (Batman... anyone?)At the end of the movie I was taken, shaken, even cried a bit,
incapable of standing up and go home while the end titles rolled,
overwhelmed by the superlative work of art I just witnessed.it touched some areas of my soul I buried under many layers of mediocre
adulthood, I was a boy again reading Asimov and Heinlein, shivering in
the dark thinking how insignificant we are in the universe... how vast
is our ignorance and how hard we need to dream even to just scrape the
surface of this immensity. I thought this movie is right up there in
the Olympus of legendary movies with 2001, Blade Runner, Gattaca... Do yourself a favour and watch this movie, open your mind and try to
encompass the majestic photography, the exceptional writing, the
exceptional acting... just to comprehend the ramification and vastness
of the story takes all that you know and learned in your life. I believe this movie is perfect. 10/10
"
447,10,"
I have always been a fan of Nolan's work, My previous favorite being
'The prestige' now this has taken the top, it uses realistic science to
keep you immersed in the emotional storyline, Even using the science
itself and the theory of relativity to affect the emotional path that
Cooper follow. I cannot say too much more about the film without
spoiling it. But I can talk about the acting, Matthew McConaughey
acting is incredible, The kind of acting that deserves 10 stars
although not quite as good as he was in 'Dallas buyers club'. In
general the film really brought up the realistic view of how science
effects us in ways which we do not know and the film is definitely
worth watching,

Christopher Nolan is a true contemporary artist and his works have
conquered nearly every genre and facet cinema has to offer. Movie-goers
have been engrossed by the diverse film repertoire this visionary has
created ever since ""Memento"" hit movie screens roughly 14 years ago.
Monumental hits such as ""The Dark Knight"" or ""The Prestige"" have been
critically acclaimed while maintaining triumphant box office numbers.
Some might say Christopher Nolan has earned the nickname:
""Mr.Blockbuster"", others might say this is degrading. But all can
agree- what makes Nolan's films so memorable is the complexity of his
creative pallet and imagination. The back-story of Interstellar was kept under wraps until its release.
For the most part, no one knew what they were going in to see- except
for the fact that it was a Christopher Nolan film. This was enough to
get me through the door ( I'm also guessing most of you as well). We
all expected to find a sensational yet unpredictable plot lying at the
heart of the movie.The next obstacle on Christopher Nolan's list was Space. A realm many
legendary filmmakers have tried to subdue. After we all thought he
couldn't top his stellar story-telling abilities....BANG, comes
Interstellar. And oh boy it couldn't have come sooner! A definite
candidate for the best picture Oscar-race come February .This inter-galactic epic literally and physically surpasses the
boundaries of time, space and gravity. Although the flaws and
inconsistencies of Interstellar cannot at times be overlooked and may
even overshadow its genius- one may not deny the fact that Mr.Nolan has
forever re-defined and completely mastered the science-fiction genre.
This immersive experience is relatively close to dethroning Stanley
Kubrick's: "" 2001: A Space Odyssey "", who as well was ahead of its
time. One simply cannot compare Interstellar to most cinematic journeys
we encounter every year because it is so far ahead of its league; HELL
it is from another planet! (no pun intended).The most riveting aspect of Mr.Nolan's latest creation is his ability
to convey such a powerful message about the human condition. Any
bystander can attest to the fact that Interstellar really makes you put
things into perspective. Especially considering how insignificant the
problems we encounter in our daily lives are. We are nothing but tiny
specks of dust in the midst of the infinite and vastly superior
universe of galaxies that surround us. Lastly, Mr.Nolan does not stop at keeping us in awe of the spectacular
visual effects but reaches even further to interweave the motifs of
humanity and technology into one. We can only be left to wonder and ask
ourselves: To what extent are humans able to co-exist with machines and
where will this union take us in the future? There are endless
possibilities and our brains cannot possibly fathom the issues Nolan
raises in this film. Nolan's superb depiction of technology as a primal
necessity for humanity is captivating. His profound allegory for Interstellar: comparing technology as the
savior of humanity- serves itself as a paradox. Humans have created
technology to move forward; we need it to progress and to evolve but we
always seem to question the mechanics/logistics because- and this is
what Nolan re-iterates in Interstellar- machines have one enigmatic
flaw: no matter how advanced we built them to be, they will always
neglect the rationale of fear and love. This is what drives Cooper to
save mankind- all so that he could see his children one last time. This
is an absolute truth to being human, it is our greatest reason to live
yet serves as our greatest weakness. It is what makes us human and
ultimately different from robots.All in all, to whom it may concern and to those that are hesitant to go
see this picture- a couple words of advice: psychologically prepare for
this voyage through time and space but be wary: minds will shatter. A pure mind-boggling puzzle turns out to be a Tour De Force of
modern-age cinema. Who's have thunk it ? Perhaps its only flaw might be
that it made me waist hours after seeing it trying to make sense of all
this scientific non-sense about the theory of relativity, gravitational
pulls etc.. you get the point. The whole science background- which
plays a substantial part in the film and is equally important- is still
a bit new to me.Nevertheless, if you haven't had a chance to see it you deserve to stay
and die on earth while the rest of us namely your so called ""space
explorers"" will join Mr.Nolan and the rest of the cast aboard the
endurance.Sincerely,An admirer of beautiful filmmaking and Sir Christopher Nolan.

This movie blew my socks off. From the very beginning to the very end,
I don't think I felt a second of boredom. The movie had you captivated
the whole way.What I really found great, and surprising, was how philosophically deep
this movie was. The two central themes I made out were determinism and
survival - represented by Matt Damons ""Dr. Mann"" and Michael Cains ""Dr.
Brand"", and love, represented at different times by Dr. Brands
daughter, Anne Hathaway and the central character, Cooper, played by
Matthew Mcconoghey.From the very get-go this dichotomy is intimated by Cooper (mcconoghey)
relationship with his daughter Murph. From how he brings his children
everywhere with him to his compassionately overlooking his daughters
deceptions to come along on potentially dangerous missions, Cooper is
an intelligent man, very well educated, a fighter pilot - as well as an
engineer - but nevertheless, it is love and his commitment to his
children that we see from these first scenes in the movie.This movie is BIG. Although the science is absolutely implausible (from
the assumption that humans could survive an interstellar space mission;
to putting the human body into stasis as if muscle cells and neurons
didn't depend on continuous excitation to survive) but that was easy to
overlook with the grandiosity of the space ship and set design. You're
pulled in; you WANT to believe that this is possible, so you go along
with it.As said before, the profundity of this movies message is what got me.
It became clearer with Dr. Mann (damons) admission that he forged the
data about his planet; that his planet had zero viability for survival.
He had went to the wrong one and - evidently - was insanely bent on
getting back to the twirling spaceship without mcconoghey and Hatheway.During this entire scene, Damons character tries to justify to himself
what he's done. As Cooper struggles to breathe, Dr. Mann asks him ""do
you see your children?"" assuming that everything which governs human
nature is solely a manifestation of 'the urge to survive'. Instead of
treating his relationship with his children as built on something more
profound and enigmatic - the pull of love - Dr. Mann sees it as
contemporary selfish gene theorists believe: it's all just 'survival'
instinct. His children - what they mean to him - are just there,
popping up into his head, so that his genes will get his body and mind
motivated to survive.Earlier on, before Dr. Manns planet was selected by a 'rigorous' vote
between the 3 remaining astronauts, Hatheways character argues that
something else is motivating her; she can't explain what, but she feels
a pull - what she describes as love - drawing her to believe that they
need to go to the planet where her former lover is assumed to be.
Cooper argues that ""love"" is not scientifically defensible; while
Hatheway develops a theory that maybe love is the transcendent core of
reality; an enveloping dimension that governs the lower planes of space
and time; and that our experience of it, which defies all that is known
about basic laws and principles, draws the universe into unity.Eventually, were brought to a bifurcation point; Hatheways character
takes the spaceship to the remaining planet, while Mcconoghey (cooper)
decides on passing through a black hole to see whats on the other side.
What he discovers is nothing short of mindblowing: instead of being
blown to smithereens, Cooper is sent into a 5th dimensional realm;
finding himself within it, he sees endless bookcases in an infinite
hallway. He soon learns that this is a 'higher' perspective into the
ordinary 3 dimensional reality of his earlier life. Looking back
through time, he sees into his daughters room and sees that what she
thought was a ""ghost"" before, was in fact him trying to communicate
with her. The words 'STAY' which his daughter insisted was what the
ghost was communicating with her, was him, trying to convince his
earlier self to STAY; to not leave his daughter and humanity to certain
death by asphyxiation. As he pushes down the hallway of his 5th
dimensional personal perspective upon his earlier life, both he and his
daughter (chastain at this point) discover a way to communicate;
Mcconoghey insight that gravity defies time has given him the knowledge
that humanity needs to survive; likewise, grown up Murph intuits that
the ghost was her father, and the watch he gave her, and it's weird
movements, are a type of code she needs to interpret.By the end of the movie, we find Hatheway on a luscious alive planet
and Mcconoghey wakes up in a hospital on a floating spaceship world
just outside of Saturn (and close to the wormhole). He succeeded in
guiding his daughter to the knowledge that mankind needed to survive;
and Hatheways characters intuition - based upon love - was also
correct.By the end of the movie we learn that time and space - and our
indvidualized, atomized bodies - are united in a 5th dimensional
'superbeing' - mankind themselves; and above this, as Hatheway's
character learned, is the guiding presence of love.

In the near future, Americans face crop-blight, crippling the
agriculture industry and leading to food shortages. Atmospheric changes
caused by human activity lead to extreme weather and dust storms
effecting farmers worldwide. The planet is steadily being rendered
uninhabitable. We face food shortages, and must unite for our
collective future. Science brings us tools of progress, and connects us
with the unseen realm of quantum information science a science that
deeply influences the human psyche. Across vast distances in space-time, Gravity holds the potential to
send and receive binary signals. Cooper, our all-American Hero, is a
former NASA pilot and engineer who has turned his intelligence into
advancing the productivity of his family farm. One day on his
struggling family farm, him and his son and daughter, Tom and Murph,
spot a surveillance drone and safely intercept its binary
navigation-link in order to land it and re-purpose it for work on the
family farm, piloting their tractors. The family, including Cooper and
his daughter Murph, get a grasp of the light-based interface bridging
man and machine. We witness that humanity is gradually uniting in the
struggle against the ecological imbalances that within a short period
of time could render the planet uninhabitable. In order to find viable solutions for the future of humanity, Cooper
puts his trust in need new ideas and new technologies enabled by
science. Amidst the sand storm, in the light of the lamp, Cooper and
his daughter witness a code of light-waves a message in visual-binary
code, carried across time-space by Gravity. The code instructs Cooper
to travel to a hidden NASA complex, the coordinates of which are
cleverly conveyed via the visual binary code. At the complex, Cooper is confronted with questions and new knowledge
of the gravitational anomalies being tracked by NASA. Cooper learns of
the dire position for humanity a situation of tragedy and hope, and a
set of options: Plan A or Plan B. Since the success of the Apollo
Missions, Cooper learns that there have been several secret missions
that were kept under-raps by the US Government specifically the
Lazareth mission and the construction of an American Space Station
known as ""The Endurance"". Cooper is called to this mission against all
odds, to save humanity and his family. Cooper must leave his earthly
family in order to meet his destiny in the Cosmos. Through a large gravitational anomaly (wormhole) in our solar system,
Cooper and the NASA crew end up on a water planet and much like the
first Apollo missions, the NASA wormhole- crew drops through a cloudy
atmosphere and lands in water this time on a planet light-years from
earth. On this watery planet, time is altered but one thing endures
the love of Cooper for his family and his purpose to save the human
race. The mission continues with its ultimate purpose to save humanity,
and we are introduced to enduring concepts we begin to think as a
species across multiple lifespans. We begin to see it in perspective.
We use science transcending time-space to set thousand-year goals for a
humanity achievable goals that unite us in peace and security, via
technology. We find that we need to evolve human consciousness on our
planet. NASA is surely capable of offering tangible solutions that we
can hold in our hands. solutions that don't need to be kept secret.
The gravitational anomalies enable quantum data transmission, through
the wormhole, via rudimentary visual binary data transmission. NASA
enables the crew to overcome challenges and unite via instruments for
psychological solidarity and singularity. It is more than just NASA now it is the voice-of-light and reason
calling all of humanity together into the hope of these new, higher
worlds. Inside the event horizon is a quantum singularity where data
can be transmitted back to earth in quantum bits represented by light
and guided by Gravity. Through this light, we collectively work at our
home base to solve problems and unite into a higher level of
consciousness. Friendly robots augment our archival functions and work
to enhance human memory, strategy, communication, navigation, and
teamwork. Will Cooper be able to save humanity? This suspenseful thriller leaves
us waiting questioning human consciousness and capability. What tools
will NASA bring to us to move us forward? Watch and see. We acknowledge
a handshake across dimensions. Something inside us will live forever
as a light unto the galaxy perhaps setting up camp in new homes in
planets amidst new stars making us Interstellar.

In fact, the best movie of all time.What can I say, I saw Interstellar with my friends and two days later I
saw it again. This movie has completely changed my perspective in film
and the effect it can have on an audience. I left the theatre awe
struck and attempting to process the genius of a movie I had just seen.
Personally, Si-Fi is not my favorite genre, in fact I do not enjoy most
science fiction movies however this one is somewhat different to the
others. For one the storyline is amazing and it had me hooked from the
very beginning to the very end. Not in any point did i become bored or
tired during the three hours, it took me through a thrilling, exciting
and enthralling journey. The characters are phenomenal and the casting
was prefect. The visuals are out of this world and completely slaps
'Gravity' across the face. The only problem I had with the movie is
that there were some plot holes and problems with logic which you are
obviously going to deal with black holes which humans have little
knowledge of. However it didn't bother me much because I was too busy
falling in love with the movie.All i have to say is watch this movie! it is equipped with a gripping
storyline and spectacular special FX making this movie an absolute
masterpiece.
"
452,10,"
Okay so when i get home from my daily activity, i get the chance to
watch ""Interstellar"" alone. The first 1/4 of the movie have one of the
best caliber of Drama which is the best way to understand each
characters in this movie. This movie is intriguing right from the
start, so the 169 minutes you spent watching this movie is worth every
minute.Don't be afraid that you wont understand this movie, Nolan brothers
made this movie to be as easy to understand as it can, yet complex.
This movie shows both real theory in science, and fiction (Well it's a
Sci-fi after all), every Sci-Fi movie has the narrative liberty to
explain something.You can't take this movie too seriously but every movie have the same
element which is ""moral of the story"" and the moral of the story given
from this movie had a huge impact on most people, leave a better planet
for our children.The Bottom line is, this movie is a uniquely exceptional epic Sci-Fi
with the right choice of actors, music, visual experience. Truly the
state of the art in Sci-Fi movie making, 10/10.

I walked in to interstellar and for the first time in a good while,I
truly didn't know what to expect from the film. I am a big fan of
Nolan's work and I had been waiting for months to see this film in full
VIP and i must say i was worried, with the over-hyping that tends to
surround big films, that i would be disappointed.I couldn't have been more wrong about this film it made me laugh, jump
out of my seat and even made me cry. There where points where I could
literally feel my jaw drop.The visuals where absolutely breathtaking, the music was fantastic ,
actors performances strong and the story was gripping with twists only
Nolan could pull off.Interstellar isn't without its faults but its refreshing to see a film
try something new and exiting in what seems to be the age of corny
remakes and prequels. This movie took the cinema experience to a whole
new level and had me pondering my existence by the end.Interstellar could prove itself to be the modern 2001: A Space odyssey,
a film thats influences can be deeply felt throughout the film but
while 2001 can be seen as more religious experience interstellar
tackles the more human aspects of humanity's endeavors and existence in
space.Overall this film is a must see in a full cinema experience and as much
as I now await the DVD release(if i don't find myself back in the
cinema to see it again) part of me knows it just wont be the same.

I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan. But when I went to watch this
movie I had my own fears. Nolan's yet another foray into a different
genre. Is he turning into those superstar directors who make commercial
blockbusters? But I was happy to find that Christopher Nolan has
outdone himself once again. I am not saying that Inception or Memento
were lesser in anyway but this movie really stands out. He has
surprised me to come up with yet another strong subject and still
manage to control it with a strong script.The movie keeps you on the edge throughout except for first few
minutes. Once the movie picks up it remains interesting till the end. I
am usually afraid of such space thrillers which can leave you with open
ends. Another fear that I developed while watching the movie. But I
proved to be wrong again. Interstellar managed to convey the message
with very clear words. It does not leave you with open questions.I think Nolan knew what he wanted to be communicated and was able to do
so by keeping the authenticity of the movie. No use of green screen can
be challenging but when you have to communicate with audience on a
complex subject you have to be truthful to yourself and to the movie.
His choice of staying away from unnecessary technological tools (3D,
green screen and CGIs) keeps the mood of the actors and thus giving a
chance for audience to get involved.Besides Nolan's work, Matthew McConaughey has done a brilliant job.
Background score is amazing and very befitting. The emotional
connection between a father and his daughter is also maintained very
well.I also like Nolan's faith in the audience. His belief that people are
looking for challenges and they want to see more than just simple
stories is one reason why he can take challenging subjects and still
keep them interesting for people like me.And finally the words from Dylan Thomas' poem really speak the
philosophy of the whole movie. 'Do not go gentle into that good night,
old age should burn and rage at close of today, rage rage against the
time of the light.'With all these elements Nolan has still managed to deliver a
commercially successful movie. This is one of those 500 movies which
you should watch before dying.
"
455,10,"
Interstellar is one movie that will make you wonder that you cannot
achieve perfection in movie making as perfection itself can only be
perceived. Christopher Nolan, you just perceived and created a master
piece in movie making. Anyway, this one is the closest to one the best
movies ever. Never have I got goosebumps in a movie that would last for
minutes. It is a treat to the mind, leave alone the eyes and the
effects. Matthew McConaughey you have set some standards here, to
perform with such intent is unbelievable.""We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars,
now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt."" Before
going for this show I was in a state of confusion, thought of waiting
for it to arrive on torrent as it was not released in 3D. I wondered as
to why Nolan did not shoot in 3D, well I cant say 3D would have ruined
the movie but I also cant say that I missed the 3D because the movie is
a 10/10 when it comes to moving you to the core. The effects achieved
are undeniably superb and you will not miss the glasses.WARNING: If you want to wait to watch this on TV or PC, you should be
ashamed of yourself. This is a once in a lifetime experience to travel
with the characters Nolan has so well directed.I will go to the theaters once again and I am sure I will have the
watery eyes and the feeling of Space and Time travel.
"

One of the best part of Nolan's movies is that it makes you think. He
provokes you to watch it over and over again to grasp every aspect of
the story. INTERSTELLAR is no different. Interstellar begins in an era on our planet where there is scarcity of
food. Human race is going to become extinct if the problem is not taken
care of. Cooper, an ex-pilot in NASA is working as a farmer. He lives
with is son, daughter and father in-law. Whatever happens in the first 40-45 minutes of the movie is as
important as the remainder of the film. It is very important to
concentrate during the course of the movie because even a little lack
of attention will create a mess in your brain. You don't want to miss
the stunning visuals this movie has to offer. As the movie proceeds,
there is an emotional factor that plays a very profound part in the
movie. At the end of this complex saga, it is Love that surpasses the
space-time continuum. The affection and relationship between Cooper &
his daughter, Murph is explained beautifully and how this relationship
blends into a different galaxy inside a wormhole can only be imagined
by the creative and beautiful minds of Jonathan and Christopher Nolan. Hans Zimmer has once again created Oscar worthy soundtracks for
Interstellar. His background music synchronizes with the movie's key
moments so well that it gives you goosebumps on several occasions. It is one of the greatest odysseys you'll ever watch. Do not miss this
masterpiece.

An definite IMAX must see. The cinematography has an incredible blend
of imagery and theoretical physics. The eerily realistic depiction of a
earth broken from climate change sends a chilling warning to what we
are leaving behind for future generations. An exhilarating masterpiece
comparable to a modern day 2001 Space Odyssey.Plan on seeing this at least a few more times to take it all in and
really enjoy anything I might have missed the first go round. Nolan
continues to impress, with out a doubt he is one of the best in the
business. I hope we continue to see this type of caliber of work from
him and his team.
"
458,10,"
This movie is not a science fiction movie. It's a perfect dramatization
of current popular time&space theories.This theories themselves are not science in my opinion, they're just
speculations of scientists so the director's success is on reflecting
these speculations on big screen with a great cinematography.You can find all main physics theories and paradoxes on time and space
in Interstellar. The movie is mainly based on strings theory (i.e.
multidimensional universe theory, the theory of all, if I'm not wrong).
Also, I've never thought that I could literally cry for "" the twins
paradox"". So it's perfect art again.You should watch this movie on big screen and on Imax if you're
interested in wormholes, relativity, time travel etc. Don't wait for
BluRay.

Anything that can go wrong, can or will go wrong. This is how Wikipedia
quotes Murphy's Law. But Christopher Nolan gave a new perspective to
this epigram. A father who has devoted his life to science desperately
trying to explain Murphy's law in a positive way to his kid daughter
gives us a whole new meaning to the adage. Cooper, played by Matthew
Mccgonaghey restates the law to his daughter which goes as 'Whatever
can happen, can or will happen'. Little did he imagine about what might
happen to the future of string theory.Time travel is not new to us. The anime Stein's Gate gave bizarre
meaning of time travel. It was a little hard to believe, yes. But we do
not see ourself building a time machine in the foreseeable future. Time
travel machines, teleporting machines are some of the areas in quantum
physics which need utmost understanding of string theory. Even Dr.
Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory (TBBT) was not able to prove it
theoretically. The episode '43 Peculiarity' shows a hypothetic situation where Dr.
Sheldon Cooper discovering a portal to communicate with other species
of different dimensions. What do we understand by dimensions? Where
have they erupted from? Evolution is the answer. We are in a stage
where we have evolved from single celled organisms living in single
dimension space to multi celled organisms living in a three dimensional
space. Only evolution can introduce us to four or five dimensional
spaces.If the three distance axis x,y and z are cover up three dimensions of a
space, what could probably be a fourth dimension if there was one?
Vivid scientific imagination tells us that if we do evolve to
experience 4D space, variables such a time could be one of the
dimensions. To explain this in a simpler way, we can move
forward/backward, to the left/to the right or up/down (if not for
gravity) in a three dimensional space we now live in. now if there was
a fourth dimension such as time, i.e., if we lived in a room in which
time was contained, we will be able to move forward and backwards in
time, and eventually end up having an infinite space time. This is
basically what we fantasize as time travel, walking up and down the
time corridor as we please.Instead of building a far-fetched machine to achieve time travel, Chris
Nolan has gone to explore the infinite probabilities present in the
unexplored areas of space. Black holes, worm hoes take us into a
totally new dimension of infinity. I was under the impression that
infinity could only be experienced through dreams. Nolan has proved me
wrong. Matthew Mccgonaghey, once quoted in the TV Show True Detective 'Time is
a flat circle'. Till date, I have had debates in my head on what that
phrase meant. I still haven't reached a conclusion. Thought time was
going in circles along the circumference of a circle, and that whatever
has a beginning must eventually end. But Interstellar showed me that
time was not going in circles. Time was a flat circle indeed but just
the path traced by the radius of a circle. It was the whole area of a
circle. Time is the circle. Maybe it meant what goes in has to come out
at the other end, I have no idea. But it is worth pondering about. Let's assume we did cross the time barrier and go on to a new
dimension, what would drive us to evolve? Emotions. Something which
automatically controlled probes lack. A human touch is needed in such
cases because what drives us is the fear of death, fear of losing
someone, fear of extinction of the human race. It is total fiction to
actually communicate with others through time travel. But maybe, will
it be possible through human emotions? Some things are a bit more than
science. And such things are meant to be 'not understood'. This is what
a 169 minute movie has done to me. A philanthropic attempt to save the
world using quantum physics sums up the movie. Simple epigram, quantum physics, evolution, science fiction, time
travel, infinity, time, philosophy of time, emotions. All of these were
portrayed flawlessly in a single movie. There could have been other
films with such deep thoughts, but no other movie could have had a
better outreach to common man like Nolan's Interstellar. To a number of
sleepless nights pondering over this film's inner meanings, 'Do not go
gently into that good night'

Hey, kiddos!I'm going to give you a run down as to why the film was amazing based
on fact and interpretation (and its flaws, warts and all....) without
telling you about other irrelevant stuff (like the theatre or the
popcorn like other reviewers do.Anyway, Visuals and Audio Amazing, its a Nolan film of course they are
going to be good, no lag or glitching, visuals were fluid with a
fitting and moving soundtrack.Acting Matthew McConaughey: emotional and convincing, perfectly
executed with some of the most invoking performances and scenes i have
ever seen.Anne Hathaway: she was also very good, perhaps overshadowed by the
acting giants Caine and McConaughey but still delivered one of her
finest performances.Michael Caine: Outstanding, after seeing McConaughey i didn't think he
could be topped, then a particular scene (no spoilers) was so provoking
and convincing you can see why Caine is an acting legend.Overall - Astounding.Storyline The notions in this film were original and wonderfully
explored, the way the elements of the story interconnected, flaws of
humanity and our inner fears demonstrated and of course the science and
fantasy of it. However, it fell slightly short here, but not through
lack of good storytelling but that it was too good. It was quite
technical for normal audiences when it came to the science, i was fine
but some of you may not be, if you don't like thought provoking films
or aren't particularly interested in science (sci-fi) then this isn't
for you, if your the other 90% then i unreservedly recommend this film
for you. i went in with above average expectations and this delivered.
It is now my favourite film as every one of the factors for the movie
bonded with each other to create the biggest sci-fi masterpiece since
2001: a space odyssey.So, overall an ASTRONOMICAL verdict and a film you really need to see.I always take the time to UNBIASEDLY assess a film, so i put the fan
boy aside and analyse it, i stand by my analysis...See you around Kiddoes!
"
461,10,"
Firstoff: forget about all the reviews. Go out watch the movie, you
won't ever see anything like this again.Now the long version: As expected the visuals are amazing, the buildup
of the story is maybe a bit too quick at the beginning, the emotional
impact would have been much greater, if the family story has been given
more depth, I also would have appreciated it, if they took more time
for technical details, for a more realistic feeling.Christopher Nolan has always been at his best with Mind Games (like in
Memento), but not necessarily in showing great emotions. Some called
the movie sentimental, I think its quite contrary, if the darkness of
the universe lies between you and your loved ones, it's expected that
you will shed a tear or two. I actually would have appreciated it, if
some (very good) emotional scenes were given the proper time, they kind
of feel rushed through, for the story's sake.I admit, wouldn't there be the last 15 minutes or so, this is a very
good movie, but not a masterpiece. But there are the last 15 minutes,
they just about change everything of our understanding, and the
emotional impact it has, is enormous. I won't say anything more.And yes, I just simply ignored the last 5 minutes of the movie.
"
462,10,"
So, as a Nolan fan I just couldn't wait until the release of this film.
Nolan movies has always blows my (and everyone) mind for years. Since
his first movie to the last one before this. I was afraid of the hype
that got Interstellar. I was afraid that this will be Bad movie of
Nolan, since all of his previous work as been critically acclaimed. But
anyway, I believed that this will be another masterpiece! And man, I
was so right!What a movie! Another masterpiece by ""The Great Nolan(s)""! It's the
most original idea in a movie since Inception in 2010, also by
Christopher. As everyone says, it's so emotional. Matthew is also
brilliant as any actor in the movie. So, we got a world that humans can
live difficulty. People just wants to survive. The only option is to go
to another planet, but since our galaxy doesn't have a livable planet,
people needs to go to another galaxy, through wormholes. Since the
first second of the movie and to the last one, you just got a big
mystery in it. In your mind you got a lot of questions.So, who's the villain here? The answer is TIME. If they only got more
time. They got fuel, they got robots, everything but not time. Time is
relative. And the ending, oh the ending. The ending will make you cry for all
that journey. When Copper meets his ""old"" daughter is simply a great
scene.You need to experience this movie in cinema. Don't even wait for
Blu-Ray. It will never worth as cinema experience. I am so mad that my
country doesn't have an IMAX theater.Just see it! Absolutely the best movie of 2014. It deserves the Oscars
for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. (I am sure that will get
Oscars for Special Effects)10 out of 10

Tonight i saw one true masterpiece . From all points of view . There is
mastery in this movie in every way you look at it . From acting to
special effects , from the imagery to the heart pounding soundtrack and
last but not least , to the mind bending script , everything work
together to provide the audience something that they will never forget.
Go see it to cinemas . It is the only movie this year that deserves it
that much . Nolan has done it once more . I think this movie , the
movie in which he uses sentiment more than any other of his ,
ultimately is his best work . Open your mind and you'll end looking up
at the stars .
"

Unrestrained.That is the first thought that comes to my mind when i
think of Interstellar.The film begins showing us that the days on our
planet are numbered(only corn grows in the fields and that soon will
stop too).So there is a starvation problem ,that by the days, will get
bigger and bigger.NASA has already sent 12 scientists on 12 different
planets beyond our solar system, to find out if there is a chance that
any of these planets can be inhabited.3 of them have sent data ,that
humans can survive on their planets.So a spaceship starts the journey
to find out , which planet is the best for mankind to survive.Well
that's the start but i can't tell you anymore and there are so many
yet. The effects,yes, are unbelievable ,BUT they don't ""overtake"" the
film.You won't go out of the theater thinking firstly about the
effects. You will be thinking going out of the cinema, about the
incredible effort that was made from the characters of the film,you
will be thinking about true love ,not only from a man to a woman ,but
from a human to any other human ,you will be thinking about life ,about
progress and about emotions.The music score is magnificent ,it bonds so
well with the movie(the scenes that alternate between the father and
the daughter are unbelievable).Congratulations to all the stuff and
crew of the movie.What else can i say?Interstellar is definitely a movie you will never forget.

Hollywood has become very sucky! Spiderman is rebooted for a third
time. The Hobbit which was an extremely thin book is a three part
movie. Let's now even begin with comic book overkill.But this movie stands heads over everything Hollywood has produced in
the last few years. The movie is a long stretch at 3 hours, but it is
an incredibly good 3 hours.What sets this movie apart is its originality, and classic SciFi basis.
In the past SciFi has been altered to include Fantasy aspects, but not
this movie. The acting was superb, and while I could go on and on, it
boils down to one thing. If you like a good SciFi movie you will like
this movie.

By far the best science fiction movie i've ever seen. This is a truly
masterpiece in all perspectives. Primarily an achievement of
cinematography. Words can't describe this visual master work. It has a unique realistic
feel for a science fiction movie mainly because Nolan avoids using CGI
whenever possible. But everything is supremely matched and the result
is a film that will blow you away.Few movies can travel your mind in such a beautiful journey. Since i
watched Prometheus i thought there will be many years until i see again
even a slightly better science fiction film. Well, i was wrong... Overall 11/10
"
467,10,"
This movie is a piece of art. Personally I love science and to see all
of the new theories and discoveries put together is just exciting. The
music is terrific. Sometimes overpowering as it is meant to be. I have
seen this movie twice. The music still brings up the emotions i felt in
this movie. Acting is great and better than most movies recently.
However if you do not like depth, if you do not like to think then this
movie is not for you. It is long and if you are not actively engaged in
the movie you will feel it. I love this movie and is now in my top 5.
This movie captures the human spirit with both the positive and
negative aspects. I might just go see it a third time :)
"
468,9,"
This film captures emotion like nothing I've seen in the theaters for
years. The music, visuals and characters are all true art. We've grown
so used to big budget superhero flicks every month that when something
like this comes along that can only truly be appreciated at a deeper
level we think its unfinished. It's greatest flaw is that though I
understand the emotions of all the characters at an incredibly deep
level, I don't truly understand the characters themselves. This is most
likely why critics have been saying Nolan went too big. If the film had
been another hour of character development it would have been perfect.
Sadly, this isn't possible in this industry. Still an excellent 9
stars. Nolan's greatest and most ambitious work by far.
"
469,10,"
Christopher Nolan is a great director and this film show us a emotion
full universe where love is bigger power.His Films always are for think, here we must feel and assimilate all
situation and characters.may that there are too information and slow start don't like you, but
the visual effect and what you feel in all scenes is very good. Do not compare the movie with the same theme as other gravity since
Nolan shows other development in history.The final will be discussed and some details may be inexplicable that
the film but you will have a good time .Great film and recommend it.
"
470,10,"
This is the kind of movie some will find brilliant while others will
say they don't understand the fuzz and rate this movie with 1 star.Well I can tell you this much, I rated 10/10 because I've never
experienced a movie in a movie theater like I have experienced this
one, ever. I saw it with my 11 year old son to whom it's also by far
the most entertaining film he's ever seen. 3 hours is long for an ADHD
kid, especially if it's (sometimes) hard to understand because he's
young (wormholes, black holes, space-time, etc). He was sitting next to
me showing me and making me touch his sweaty hands. I've never seen him
more excited. Today, 3 days later he still talks about it the whole
time, asking me questions about the theory of relativity and other
technical stuff from the movie.People rating this film 1/10 claim they've just seen the worst possible
movie.. I don't think so. I read complaints like: the earth will never
be in that state, we won't ever let that happen to our crops...all
details and open for debate, but never an issue. This is just a tool
the director uses to begin an epic tail showing what mankind is capable
of, not only technically, but also emotionally... It's about
sacrifices, lying to your loved ones to protect them or even for
greater causes...it's about insanely difficult choices...it's about
never giving up, hope... If you can't see through insignificant details
you don't agree with or you would have done otherwise, being the
brilliant director you are, then please, don't go see it so we won't
have to read your lame review here. If you really think this movie is
worth 1 star I would recommend you to stick to the dukes of hazard

Holy Cow! Watched Interstellar with Matthew McConaughey(We Are
Marshall) as Cooper , Anne Hathaway(The Dark Knight Rises ) as Amielia
Brand , Michael Caine(The Prestige) as Professor Brand, Wes Bentley(The
Hunger Games) as Doyle , David Gyasi(Cloud Atlas) as Romilly , Bill
Irwin(Rachel Getting Married) as The A.I. TARS, Mackenzie Foy(The
Conjuring) as Young Murphy, Oscar Nominee Jessica Chastian(Zero Dark
Thirty) as Murphy and a Special Appearance from Matt Damon(Elysiun) as
Doctor Mann. Lets Just Say its honestly the best film of 2014 don't get
me wrong 2014 had some Gems in Guardians,Captain America TWS and Dawn
Of The Planet this year But Interstellar blew them out of the water The
film was an electrifying Science Fiction Adventure it was awesome it
also showed the toll that time travel can take on Somebodys Mind & soul
also it had an interesting twist as well also it had humor it was
Subtle humor but humor nonetheless for a being a 3 hour film it kept me
intrigued also once again amazing performance from Matthew McConaughey
also really enjoyed how they involved NASA me being a fan of the
Organization .This definitely as must buy Amazing Costume Design By
Mary Zophres(Iron Man 2) ,Score Hans Zimmer(Man Of Steel),
Cinematography By Hoyte van Hoytema(Her) ,and Direction By Christopher
Nolan(Inception) , The Best Movie Of 2014 and it usurps Inception and
The Prestige definitely Nolans Best Work 10/10

When you watch this movie, first half an hour you think how long is it
going to take for everything to start. But I don't want to spoil it, so
I'm going to do a brief summary.This movie in IMAX is one of the most visually stunning movies ever.
The stars, planets, wormholes, black holes etc are so well made. You
get emotionally attached to what happens a lot and sometimes even, you
feel like you're actually in the movie. The acting was great by
everyone.Christopher Nolan has just outdone himself. This very worth my $19 AUD
I had to pay to see it. Would love to see it again honestly.

Director: Christopher NolanWriters: Christopher Nolan and Jonathan NolanStarring: Mathew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael
CaineRelease Date: November 7, 2014Runtime: 2 hours and 49 minutesMPAA Rating: PG-13 for some intense perilous action and brief strong
languageStudio: Paramount PicturesThe plot of Interstellar takes place in the near future. Droughts,
climate changes, and dust storms, are causing Earth's resources to
diminish. Whilst finding a way to save humanity, NASA discovers a
wormhole near Saturn. They create a mission: send a spaceship into
space to go through the wormhole so it can find a new habitable planet
for a new home. A former test pilot for NASA, Cooper, who lives as a
farmer with his father in law, Donald, his son, Tom, and his Daughter,
Murph, is recruited by NASA to lead the mission. Although he is not
willing to go, due to the fact that he would be leaving his children
for an uncertain amount of time, he agrees to lead the mission with the
help of his crew members: Amelia Brand (the daughter of one of the
professors of NASA), Romilly, Doyle, as well as 2 robots, TARS and
CASE.The acting is fantastic here. Mathew McConaughey gives a one of his
best performance in his career as Cooper. People might be saying that
Christopher Nolan's films are more focused on story that character
development and I can see where they are coming from, however there is
still a good amount of humanity in his films, as most of the emotional
substance comes from the main character, such as Inception where the
side characters don't get much to do, but the main character's arc
carries the emotional weight of the film. That is also evident in
Interstellar, with the main character, Cooper. One prime example of
this is the conflict he faces with having to leave his family to save
all of humanity. That emotional moment was really well done and it
makes you feel for the character of Cooper. Although McConaughey's
performance overshadows the others, that doesn't excuse the fact that
the rest of the cast are great as well. The performances, such as Anne
Hathaway, Michael Caine, and Jessica Chastain are all great in this
film. Overall, the acting is fantastic.Visually, this movie beyond passes. I really that I had seen this movie
in IMAX, because it would have easily suited the format (I'll
definitely buy it on Blu-Ray though). This is the first Christopher
Nolan not to have Wally Pfister as the cinematographer since Following,
and WOW the cinematography is fantastic. The scenes in space and when
the characters are going into a black hole looked beyond amazing, and
the fact that Nolan used practical effects makes the visuals all the
more outstanding, because they all look real. The soundtrack by Hans
Zimmer is also great. Overall, this film will definitely win best
cinematography, best visuals, and best director at the Oscars (or at
least get a nomination for each of those).Now, lets talk about the script. First off, I'd like to say that this
film is a thrill ride. Not only doest it get you emotionally invested
in the main character (for reasons that I said before), but it also
raises the stakes for the problems that he and his crew are facing. As
the problems get bigger and bigger, you really become one the edge of
you seat and the film become incredibly exciting. I don't want to get
into spoilers so I won't say what they are, but you should see the film
to see my point. I also cannot deny that this is one of the most
ambitious and thought provoking films out there. There are so many
interesting ideas and the scope is just massive.Overall, Interstellar is one truly amazing film and I could honestly
call it this decade's 2001: A Space Oddssey (I haven't seen that film,
but I really want to). IT is incredibly ambitious and it has some
fantastic visuals and a great scope. However, the film also manages to
have some emotional resonance through Cooper's well-written character
arc, which is also thanks to Mathew McConaughey's Oscar worthy
performance (though I do think that Andy Serkis' voice of Ceaser from
Dawn of the Plane of the Apes will win). I know that critics are saying
that it's good but not great, but it's honestly one of my, if not my
favorite film of 2014 so far.FINAL SCORE: A+ (100%)

I watched Interstellar in IMAX. I've seen trailer before but it doesn't
look interesting to me. But still I decided to watch movie, because
it's Christopher Nolan. And I don't regret it! From the beginning movie
is take my breath away with perfect visual effects and excellent music.
When trailer was kinda about nothing, movie takes interesting
characters and takes them to the travel into darkness of space and
time. Each of them has it's story and moral that turned into perfect
team of 4 astronauts. They are have they missions and prerogatives, and
it will led them into unknown... Great actors, Michael Kane as usual in
Nolan movies and other co-star from A-list, brilliant plot twist and
magnificent experience. This is... Interstellar
"
475,10,"
I look at Interstellar as a one of kind film that is in ways more than
just a great film, it transcends beyond the philosophical, scientific,
visual and emotional standards of the 'average' masterpiece. It's a
poetic tribute to our potential as a species, our capacity to go beyond
our reaches and our capacity to hold on to what we love.I feel immensely connected to this film, in this modern age- obsessing
about new scientific theories and philosophies. The film holds a
brilliant sense of accuracy while giving acknowledgement to the
mysteries of science and the Universe.Not much needs to be said about the groundbreaking technical
achievements. To me the whole film is perfectly wrapped and wound. This
is a film that's meant to exist in a sense that this is the
quintessential film about the future of the human species, innovation
and space travel. Therefore everything feels like it's fallen in the
right place.

This is my first review ever but I will keep it short. I only created
an account to share this review, because of a bit of unfortunate
trolling imposed on this movie by some seriously know-it-all reviewers.This is a pioneering movie: one that will set the stage for all
futuristic apocalyptic space- related sci-fi movies. It is a unique
Nolanian masterpiece, which proves that Christopher Nolan and his team
never fail to deliver. -I will not get into the plot as I do not want
to ruin anything for the new viewers who will join the rest of us in
witnessing what is the best movie, at least of the 21st century...let
us not forget the classic ones (The Godfather etc). However, this movie
IS the best space movie ever to be released.Let me just say this: the movie touches upon many scientific theories
on space and time, particularly focusing on quantum physics, the theory
of relativity and last but not least, string theory. It is a sci-fi
movie people...not a lecture on these topics. It utilises existing
science and based on assumptions (even wild ones) it leads us to an
awesome journey of constant discovery, which however one might think of
it as unrealistic, it is believable. THAT is what is so great about
this movie, along with amazing performances, directing, screenplay,
music, sound effects and cinematography. I am sure many people will
diss this movie and say proudly out loud to their friends that it is
complete bullshit and physics don't work this way.. Let me say
this...if you wanted an actual lecture on physics then I suggest you
enrol at a university course. It is a sci-fi movie and an excellent
one. To sum up: UNIQUE FILM - SETS THE STAGE FOR NEXT FILMS BUT UNLIKELY TO
BE SURPASSED SOON (remember how you felt when Gravity came out?...100
times that feeling)

Let's just say you're on a plane, you just buckled up and the plane
just took off. You're feeling steady, becoming comfortable, being calm,
embracing silence, just living the moment; and out of the blue the
plane converts itself into a space shuttle and begins its journey into
outer space, then it travels into a nearest wormhole with turbulence
and lands you in places you can only imagine. Now the intensity of the
excitement you would feel depends upon how best you could picture the
above words. ""Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one
as Christopher Nolan ever in flesh and blood walked upon the historic
moments of film making in the 21st century."" That was the only quote I
was able to comprehend in my mind after watching Interstellar. This may
sound a little bit cliché but yeah, I am short of words.I have heard so many say Interstellar is nowhere near to Kubrick's cult
classic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". I am afraid this movie stands next to
it in every aspect but it is just a matter of time. This movie will
freeze your mind, screws it up in all angles then returns you to normal
state when every scene in the movie starting to make sense in the end.
I an not much of a spoiler and I won't reveal any detail about the
movie. I hate to say this but if Leo were to get nominated for next
years Oscars, then he will surely lose to this man Matthew McConaughey,
his action will give you a heartbreak in an emotional journey of
Space-Time curvature thriller. This movie may give hint and inspire
NASA to think about the possibilities and expanding their vision in
Interstellar space travel. I can't really say I understood the entire
movie but I will have to watch it again to put the puzzle pieces back
together.Interstellar is a slow drug, it slowly injects its concept into your
mind and will take its own time to give you a clear understanding of
the metaphoric subject. If you're a space fan and you just would love
to tap on the rear of science as it passes by, then this movie is not
for you. You will need to make ""Space Subject"" your intercourse buddy
to know what this is really about.My mind is still processing what I just did watch back there.
"

This movie was surely one of the best titles I have ever seen. Gravity
WHAT? Mind blown. This movie takes one of the top favorites for me this year.
I have seen a few movies in 2014 I've really loved but I really can't
rave enough about Interstellar!!!Through the actors, visual effect artists and writers, the story plot
is fantastic. Nolan has outdone himself and there might not be a movie
that can top this in years. If you've ever wanted to go to space or
have loved NASA as a kid, you will want to go to space after this
movie!Being a weather geek I love space and time and science, no matter what
age you are, this movie is for you! Don't let those mixed reviews
confuse you, or people saying oh its going to be boring, you'll thank
yourself for going.

Christopher Nolan's films have always been ambitious, but never,
really, very moving or outwardly emotional. When compared to a
Spielberg, or, more recently, a J.J Abrams, his output can even be said
to be cold to the touch. Nobody remembers Inception for the Cobb-family
reunion, or The Dark Knight for the death of Rachael. Yet, with
Interstellar, Nolan and his brother bear their hearts and souls into a
science-fiction odyssey that, remarkably, feels as hard as it thinks,
and the result is astonishing, profound, majestic cinema.It seems fitting that Steven Spielberg would pass on the script, as if
it were the passing of the torch to a younger, fresher pioneer. The
script itself, though concerned with such heady, trippy ideas as a
'tesseract', 'wormholes' and a 'bulk' is, when boiled down, the story
of a father and his daughter. Crucially, though the events span through
space, time and dimensions, Nolan never loses grip of the emotional
crux of the film. The film opens slowly, and establishes the family
element very effectively. Cooper (McConaughhey) is a man out of time,
who, in the words of a disheveled John Lithgow, 'was either born 40
years too late or 40 years too early', someone who is not content to
keep his head down and simply survive in a dying, fascinatingly
Dust-Bowl-esque Earth. When the plot finally kicks in, we get the sense
of detachment, and the Nolans deal with the separation of Murph (played
in young form by Mackensie Foy) and Cooper with a sensitivity not seen
before. Here, Nolan is pushing his own boundaries with the human
elements. At times, he grasps too far and the film strays into
self-importance, what with the overtly preachy 'love transcends time
and space' shtick. Even so, the raw emotion at play here is
impressively complex and layered, and works brilliantly when spliced
against the exploration, saving all of mankind stretch of the second
and third acts. Such faltering moments lose their significance when
there are so many truly great (not blockbuster great, great great)
scenes and stretches. A sequence demonstrating the effects of
time-dilation through a series of earth-bound messages presents the
film's humanity and brilliance perfectly, and also shows how
McConaughey deserves a mention come Oscar time.Of course, the spectacle on show is unlike anything ever seen before,
but Interstellar is surprisingly light on action set-pieces. Indeed,
the November release date and lack of a showpiece sequence suggests
that perhaps Chris Nolan is attempting to move away from the 'big
blockbuster' label that The Dark Knight trilogy has perhaps tagged him
with. That the film remains compelling throughout the mammoth running
time is testament both to the writing, and certainly the magnificent
cast. The script, whilst also handling the human drama with sensitivity
and a beautiful simplicity that lends the film its immense,
tear-jerking emotional power, it also explores the science and 'big
ideas' with skill and tons of intelligence. It obviously helps that
they had Kip Thorne to help them, a leading scientist in the field of
black-holes, time relativity and 'fifth dimensions'. It certainly works
in their favour, as whilst the science is laid on thick, it never
hampers the experience itself, but rather, it adds another layer of
intrigue to the events. If anything, the confusion adds to the
bewildering, beguiling third act, which is, in terms of pacing, plot
and character, the strongest of the film, where Nolan dares to answer
most, if not all, of the questions he asks. It's a bold move, and one
that truly brings a feeling that Interstellar could be his masterpiece.
The work of his cinematographer, who's previous work on Her and Tinker,
Tailor, Soldier, Spy was also superb, lends the film an almost
indescribable beauty, and awe-inspiring sense of scale. It is, perhaps,
the best visual representation of space ever created, and definitely
earns the right to be considered against the mighty sci-fi classics
2001: A Space Odyssey, and Blade Runner.This holds up in terms of casting, which is perhaps the strongest Nolan
has got to work with so far. Matthew McConaughey continues to astound,
but here he shows a masterful restraint, and is thus the perfect
leading man, oozing charisma and charm, but also an emotional
restraint, anchoring the visual spectacle and huge narrative
developments and reveals. Michael Caine is finally given a genuinely
important supporting role, with a disquieting performance of the
scientist who leads Cooper 'into that good night', and provides a
substantial amount of the film's issues and dramatic tension. Hathaway
manages to be likable in perhaps the weakest role, and her relationship
with Cooper brings further depth. It is, however, Mackensie Foy's
chemistry with McCoanughey as a young Murph that shines, and she shows
superb control and maturity in the key role that forms most, if not
all, of the film's emotional power. Bill Irwin lends his charming voice
to TARS, a fascinatingly designed robot, who's interplay with
McConaughey completely charms. This is just one of many little
surprises littered throughout a film of joyous innovation and
inventiveness, but one that never loses grip of our inherent humanity.

Nolan(director) did a great job. I have never seen such a movie before.
Initially i thought its like gravity movie but it way beyond that. Very
good concept of time, gravity and 5dimensions are explained. Its a kind
of movie. Have seen it twice.Story depicts the earth is going to destroy in future and how some
scientist tried to settle down in different planet. That planet is
beyond our solar system, if fact, beyond the Galaxy. concept of
black-hole also explained.If you are missing this movie then you are missing a lot i must say.It explains how we all dependent of gravity, Also the very interesting
fact- One hour in some planet equals to seven year in earth. It means
if a person stays in other planet for 4 hour, he is 28 years old in
earth. Likewise the daughter of actor was much older then his father in
the movie.
"
481,10,"
I just love this film. The director took the right way to express all
the idea. If you love the science, you will love this master piece. The
actors are just beasts, Matthew McConaughey has shown all of us that he
is a really good actor and I am so happy that he took this way and this
plot in his career, because it's just amazing. The way that the film
explains the relativity and the space-time is brilliant, and the end
it's just shocking. I just have good words for this film. One of the
best things of this master piece is that make us reflex about all the
future and if there is a possibility to find another planet to habit.
Totally recommended.
"
482,10,"
Cooper, in an urgency to save the human race from the dying earth,
leads the team of top scientists to explore a wormhole that is made
possible to find a new planet for humanity. Not only does he have to
decide to leave his family behind, but he has also to make many hard
decisions in the fight against the deceitfulness undermining the
journey.I was compelling by several tag lines that pop up several times at
appropriate moments throughout the movie. The movie moves forward at
right speed with the plot which is well organized and keeps generating
new curiosity with twist and turn from start to finish. The movie was
interesting and full of scientific ideas on the most fascinating
concepts of gravity, space, time, and dimension. ""What would you do if
you traveled back to the future seeing everyone you knew getting old on
the world that you just left a few years ago?""It is not the ghost that is speaking to Cooper's daughter. You would be
surprised to find out the one who was trying to talk to her. This is
not a fight against an evil force from the outside world. The movie is
a race against time and space using human intellectual, courage, and
love to save human race. For this movie: a moment to watch, a lifetime
of memory.
"
483,10,"
My first favorite film... never had one before!Obviously a few sentences can't do this film justice; its a true
diamond in the manure pit of remakes that Hollywood just keeps pumping
out.Its a compelling story if you're into sci-fi and space exploration. If
you're a fanatic-- then this is wet dream. The film is even more
beautiful than the trailer-- unlike many recent releases!The emotional impact took me by surprise. The emotional range of so
many films today is so low its almost like trying to discern a symphony
through a tin can. Not so here. I FELT the excitement, grief, anger, of
each character quite starkly. The film wraps up beautifully-- no
spoilers here. Just want to let you know that I found it very
satisfying.If you go see this in true 70mm IMAX you're going to be in for a treat.
Some of the most stunning space sequences are in full IMAX resolution,
and it is possibly the most immersive experience available to date.
"

This is my first review on IMDb and I am really excited to write it for
this particular movie.First I want to say that you have to see this movie on IMAX and no
other way! For me, this is the only way you can enjoy the movie
completely.INTERSTELLAR was a beautiful masterpiece. I am no huge sci-fi fan but I
have seen my fair share of sci-fi movies. I can safely say that this
one makes the top of the list. Christopher Nolan has created one of the
most amazing scenes I have ever seen - scenes that will make you feel
like you're part of the story. Prepare for a visual mind-blown.As to the sound - it is amazingly impressive. The music is by Hans
Zimmer so that should be enough for you, he is pure genius. Then there is Matthew McConaughey. An actor whose roles were not that
impressive in the beginning. An actor who did mostly romantic comedies.
For the past couple of years McConaughey managed to turn that around
and create some amazing characters which made me realize how talented
he is. To me INTERSTELLAR is the peak of his acting career. After
seeing him in the role of Cooper I cannot imagine any other person
being able to influence me the same way. McConaughey uses his
extraordinary talent to show us some ordinary human emotions. And he
does it in a breathtaking way. Of course the other part of the cast did
a great job as well. Anne Hathaway did a powerful performance. So did
the incredible Michael Caine.I won't say anything about the story so that I don't spoil anything.
Just go to the nearest IMAX theater and enjoy it. It's a genius
creation of the Nolan brothers. I can assure you it would be an amazing
experience.
"

After seeing this movie I felt like I had been scuba diving for 3
hours. Probably because this movie is literally taking your breath
away. It's the kind of movie that takes you in a thought suspension
that lasts for days after seeing it. The story uses understandings from
science that are just incomprehensible for a common human being. These
sciences will only be comprehended by our children's children. Just
like we now understand the world is round instead of flat and rotating
around the sun.This movie is a work of art. It jumped into my top 3 movies of all
time, joining the matrix and inception. I just love thought provoking
movies that pushes the limits of our brain's capacity.

Interstellar is one cinematic journey you will not forget.For years,
maybe forever. i am not trying to sell this movie, but this has been
one of my favourite movies to watch.It is a must that you watch in on
the big screen. This movie shows you how to make a proper science
fiction movie.It satisfies your curiosity about the meaning of
""infinity and beyond"". Nolan showed his magical talent, that he was not only making this huge
ideas interpretable on two and half hours movie, but also to make us
connect as a viewer with the movies. The Cooper family story is a one
firm stand for the storyline. They made us felt something, the same as
what Nolan wants to create in this movie, which is the meaning of hope
for the human kind. The scene where Cooper cried when he watched his
son's video,was very moving,and deserves an award winning. He was the
right choice for this movie. Anne Hathaway, a stunning performance.She
was into her character as a struggled Amelie. Mackenzie as little Murph
awes me, she was like the gems in this movie. The other line up was
very special. I could go on about all the actors but you should watch
it yourself to know how amazing these actors are. Interstellar leaves you with lots of big question about our space, out
there, a mystery that we eager to solve.It is about life after all. At
first i think that this movie was very big , but to think again, the
visualization of this movie was just very little compared to the real
interstellar that was only God that knows all about it.It was a
beautiful imaginations that made us realize that we are very small, and
the fact that we enchanted so well by this movie, was a boomer for us
that probably this is the only chances for us non NASA people to
experience the best movie about outer space. Another thing, which is very spectacular and actually the key of this
movie, is the music.They know when the right time to play the score,
and when not to play the score at all-instead leaving us with this
gripping silent that made you chill out of your nerves.It probably not going to be everyone's favourite, but i could assure
you, this will be a new cinematic experience for everyone.An
interstellar journey.
"

I believe that the film did more than enough justice to the science
fact/fiction part of it. With this movie, Christopher Nolan tried to
answer some questions that science is yet to. The transition form fact
to fiction was seamless. Even though some of the sequences in the movie
are open to scientific debate, they are simply beautiful - visually and
emotionally. As far as the story goes, I could care less as the
stunning visuals and great background score more than makes up for it. For those who are not fully satisfied with the story, I can understand,
could be because of a very high bar set by Christopher Nolan himself.
However, Don't let it hold you back if you like Nolan's movies.If you're gonna watch it, watch it in IMAX. ﻿

it is the best movie in the world, the best of the best. the best movie
i have ever seen in my entire life. i don't know what to say i love
this movie so much. love the relationship between the father and the
daughter, you see how they love each other, about Copeer he is a real
hero he did it for all humans to survive Matthew McConaughey was
PERFECT in acting i think he was the best of the actors in the movie.
love the music it makes you fell like you are really inside the movie.
the black hole and Wormhole were Amazing i love the whole scientific
things. OMG thanks for the visual effects & music. the best Actors &
Director really thank you

Simply Awesome....It was emotional,aspiring and visually dynamic......I think i haven't seen any movie this visually spectacular other than
Gravity...every piece is just brilliant.The acting, the music, the
effects, it was all in one.Best of 2014.Nolan brings the whole space on the earth...i don't know how he gets
these ideas but whatever he does,he does real...He is,in my eyes(at
least),undoubtedly most skilled movie director on the planet,Only one thing that I wasn't able to wrap my head around was the
concept of Black hole but it's acceptable coz it's a movie and we watch
it to enjoy and becoz of that concept it leaves us all heart- warmingly
emotional.It was a great movie but wasn't the best of Nolan.I still think that
the Inception is the best sci-fi movie ever made because of the story.Overall, it was a nerve-racking adventure which only Nolan can pull
off.
"

I feel that movies these days don't immerse you into the story and
setting like the older movies. So when i heard the basic plot and high
reviews of this film i thought this movie might just take me there. To
start with the positive it had a very imaginative script/story and the
scenes of Mcconaughey were very emotional and touching. The problem i
have with this movie is that it repeatedly pushes reality more and more
and more to the point where it's kind of hard to stay with whats
happening. It ended well but it doesn't make any sense how you end up
there. Also there is a mystery character 2/3 of the way through the
movie that was completely pointless sub story that pushed drama for the
sake of drama. I like the idea in which this character entered and the
actor who played him but for what transpires he might as well have just
stayed out of the movie. Still a solid movie but i wasn't left in shock
by greatness like some viewers have reported.
"

This film is brilliant. I saw it at Southampton IMAX - I had hoped it
would be in 3D but sadly it was not. That said, there were moments
where the cinematography literally had me feeling like I was floating
through space.As a qualified Physics teacher, it was really interesting how the film
managed to bring in relativity and macro- physics in a way that, whilst
stretching the imagination a little and taking a leap of faith in
suggesting there is an answer to today's unified theory conundrums, not
only made sense, but tied in completely with the bits of modern
accepted and theoretical physics that it used.The film also also used a very clever visualisation of a particular
concept, not only to try to make sense of it, but to provide a link to
the story which gave the whole film a sense of completeness and a
cracking story in one film - something sadly lacking in the current
spate of franchise-driven, often book- splitting trilogies that seem to
make up the majority of today's blockbuster movies. The method used to
visualise this took me a while to appreciate, but on reflection, I
truly believe it was the best - if not only - way to present it on a 2-
dimensional screen.I can recommend this film to everyone. I think the physics is explained
well enough in the film that is should be accessible by most, at least
enough that the movie makes sense... For those who have more of an
understanding of relativity and the effects of gravity, it is an
interesting and faithful journey. Matthew McConaughey is brilliant and believable, the juxtaposition of
the rural location where the film starts (I think mid-Texas) with the
technology and knowledge required for space exploration works very
well, and I don't know if it was deliberate, but the corn-fields were,
to me at least, a subtle and welcome nod to past extra-terrestrial
films where little green men emerge from the foliage...I don't want to spoil anything for anyone but I don't think anyone
doesn't realise this film incorporates journeys/a journey into space...
Let's just say one or more of the passengers on board bear a startling
resemblance to certain features found in 2001: A Space Odyssey. As a
pretender film buff, that homage did not go unnoticed and was a welcome
token of appreciation for an enduring critically acclaimed movie -
something which Interstellar may well in time, become itself.This film is one of the biggest films of recent times. It is unusual in
its brilliance, subtle in its complexity, and fabulous in it's ideology
and psychology. If you still have the chance to go and see it on the
big screen, stop thinking about it and go see it - on the biggest
screen you can find.

It's not too often that I hold my recommendation for a movie based on
its music, but sadly for ""Interstellar"", directed by Christopher Nolan
this was the case. The music in a good deal of the movie is so grating
and batty that I could not concentrate on the movie-watching, a total
distraction and disappointment. It was like a crazed clown playing
chord sets on an organ. Had the music been not so obtrusive I would've
given the movie a 7/10. It runs too long and needed to be edited down
especially at the beginning. The movie is not lacking ambition, and
Nolan endeavors to deal with interesting science fiction and science
phenomena. McConaughey has been in the better ""Contact"" years ago, so
is no stranger to science fiction. Hathaway tones down her role while
Michael Caine's character is quite annoying - (spoiler) his death bed
gibberish monologue was incoherent and difficult to understand. Mixed
6/10

I was once again surprised by Nolan's imagination. He brought a space
travel movie to a new level, a level so excellent that the majority of
the audience won't understand all the details in this movie. There are
some flaws in this movie, but they can be ignored by the visual effects
of black hole and wormhole...etc.Matthew Connelly is a really good actor, he totally covers other actors
in this movie...honestly..umm. Matt Damon doesn't really have a chance
to show his talent.Few tips before you watch the movie: Google the basic information of
black hole, wormhole, five dimension...etc. if you wanna go further,
google Einstein's relativity and deeper information about Gravity. :) I
googled them and felt better when I watched the movie.Anyway, a good movie does not please the audience by its entertainment;
it is honored by audience who are willing to think.

First of all prepared for a movie which is more than 2 hrs and 45
minutes long which takes a lot of patience to go through. I don't remember which movie was as long as this one is.Coming to the movie, a pickup truck runs like wild elephant even when
the tire is flat. Great!Imaginations have run wild and physics have taken a beating...when
people are in some other space..how can they walk, talk and breathe
even when they are in open!?A big ocean with mountain high waves crashing through a man made
spacecraft and the same passing under Saturn rings....pure fantasy.Good to pass time in the winter when nothing else better to do, just
have a big tub of Popcorn handy.

The movie is filled with science fiction but well everyone loves
science fiction movies right? this movie is very extraordinary because
the time loop in the movie makes the movie the best science fiction
movie ever.The movie is very emotional as well- leaving a person
telling you'll return and not coming for years is not a joke and well
when you do return being the same age is a mystery.The best part in the
movie is the coding of the watch.the movie is rated 10 by me because- i
really loved the characters and the way the have played their roles
which suited the totally. The movie shows the strong love between the
daughter and the father which is amazing. This movie definitely
deserves to get an Oscar.

If you want to nitpick scientific inaccuracies in Interstellar, you'll
surely find some, although you'll probably have a harder time than
usual in sci-fi films. But hey, if nitpicking is your goal, you
probably shouldn't see it at all.This movie is all about going beyond. Daring to try. And in this goal
it's inspiring. The cast is amazing, the story is deep and sensible,
and everything is grand, beautiful and awe inspiring. If you can, watch
in IMAX or something like it: the sound is perfect and helps the
immersion.It's hard to review this film without giving something away, so I'll
stick to this: a lot of people are criticizing it just because it's
""cult"" to dislike the popular, and Nolan IS, despite not giving a damn,
popular. But there's a reason for the ""cult"" around it's movies:
despite being far from perfect, Nolan's pictures don't underestimate
the viewer. They don't fall short of what it can be: the director don't
measure the audience by the ""average man"", he challenges this man to
struggle with something more complicated and leave the theater pleased.I watched this with my wife and my mother, and the latter had some
trouble with the technical part of relativity and especially the
ending. But even she came out of the theater aware that she saw
something special, and curious to find out the more obscure parts of
the plot.I'm pretty sure in 30 or 40 year we'll be remembering Interstellar with
a similar nostalgia that we reserve now for 2001. It's a bold
statement, I know, as are Nolan's pictures.You owe it to yourself to watch this.

movies starts at a slow pace at times i got bored but it is all
connected u can't even skip a single scene and u will be blown away in
the end.all the actors were equally good expect for Matt Damon i thought his
role was wasted but Mathew hats off man u really deserved Oscar. as far
as direction is concerned u know what Christopher Nolan does it's
always a master piece.movie could have been a little shorter i got hell tired after coming
out of cinema.if u r a fan of science fiction u will definitely love it.

I can't help but miss the early days of Christopher Nolan's work with
the likes of 'Memento' and 'The Prestige' where his movies were purely
mind-blowing, incredibly original masterpieces based purely around
story. His Batman trilogy was astonishingly brilliant in it's own way
and 'Inception' combined an amazing story with stunning visuals. With
'Interstellar' though I feel he's gone too far towards relying on the
visuals and not enough story driving it along.Don't get me wrong, there's a story there, but it doesn't feel original
enough by Nolan's standards. The 'space mission to save Earth' thing
has been done and whilst admittedly Nolan puts his own twist on it, it
still can't be saved from feeling like we've seen it all before (some
parts even as recently as Alfonso Cuarón's 'Gravity' just last year).I wouldn't say the near 3 hour run time flies by, but Nolan paces his
films so well that he can still get away with a much longer run time
than others. 20 minutes probably could've been shaved off this one
though to be honest.It's Matthew McConaughey's show from start to finish and we all know he
can carry a film. He's as charming as ever and really shows his
emotional range at times too. He just seemingly can't make a bad film
at the moment. Anne Hatheway on the other hand was a real let down for
me. After being absolutely brilliant in Nolan's 'The Dark Knight Rises'
as Catwoman I hoped she would equally blow me away in this one. It
wasn't to be though. I felt she was flat and almost complacent in the
role. The rest of the cast are strong in their performances without
anyone stealing the show.It's tough to hold films like this against Nolan. He's got the budget
these days and God knows he's earned it. Whether we'll ever see films
like 'Memento' from him again remains to be seen. But what I really
hope is that he doesn't fall back and become reliant on the big budget
carrying his films. I really do trust he's better than that. What
project he signs onto next will be very interesting indeed.
"

I consider myself a sci-fi fan. This film had pleasant and unpleasant
surprises. For one, the fairly-well established backstory seems to
indicate this film is set some time in the future. The set, however, is
remarkably devoid of any futuristic devices and improvements at all. A
farmhouse from 1975. A Dodge Ram from 2000, and a NASA spaceship from
way in the future?? Everything on the set is from present day, every
car, building, laptop, and with the amount of books in Murph's bedroom
the set almost seems to be from the past. I mean what kid has any books
today, much less in the future? This kid has a library in her room.
That disparity was a bit of a disappointment. Pleasant surprises
included the cast for me as I had no idea Michael Caine or Matt Damon
were even in the cast. This is EASILY McConaughey's best work and the
only other work he's done I enjoyed as much as this was A Time to Kill.
There is a scene with Matt Damon that absolutely scared the poop out of
me and everyone in the theater. Fantastic production with no expense
spared. And other than the ""threat to the planet"" theme and absolutely,
shamelessly STEALING a scene directly out of Event Horizon, this film
scores good originality points (although I think I've seen a Twilight
Zone with a similar theme) Last unpleasant surprises include Anne
Hathaway and her acting. She has the acting depth of Daphne from
Scooby-Doo and I dread seeing her cast in anything. Overall there is
just too much overall in this movie. Its like Indiana Jones meets Star
Trek as the protagonist overcomes insurmountable challenges too often
and too frequently. The soundtrack is loud enough to wake the dead and
that always seems to be a crutch to give impact to weak scenes. It's
not needed, the scenes are not weak. They are intense, often too
frequently, and the loud sound is unnecessary and undesirable. The
resolution is original, but VERY unbelievable unless you're 9 years
old. It REALLY puts the FICTION in science fiction, which was
disappointing since the gravity of the problems on Earth and the moral
and ethical questions pondered in the film would be lost on a 9 year
old - so why the Saturday morning cartoon ending? If you're going to
make a film for adults, please make the entire film, including the
resolution for adults. I can handle it I promise. Lastly, there is a
bit of the ADD scene hopping I first noticed in Oculus. Just stop. Stop
doing that forever. The flashing back and forth between a farm and
another galaxy with the speed of a music video only insults me as you
clumsily attempt to beat me (your viewer) over the head with your
sledgehammer of juxtaposition. Please stop making films for morons. If
they can't figure it out, they'll never miss it, but its getting
borderline offensive for normal IQ patrons. For all these reasons I
gave this movie a 7. MY GF is not a sci-fi fan and did not like it. I
better qualify that as a 7 for sci-fi fans only!

I went to watch this film with high expectations following Nolan's
constant highly respected films ever since Memento. Insomnia was good
but Memento took it up a notch. This takes it to the next level. The intensity of the story that unravels, twists and turns promises a
great cinema trip. The CGI was believable and awe-inspiring and the
acting was faultless. What ever you believe in Interstellar is not what
you expect. In my opinion this is an instant classic and for me will
remain one of the greatest movies I have ever watched. Highly recommend
for cinema goers, and IMAX will just take it to a new level of cinema.
The score was hauntingly beautiful and produced differently to Zimmer's
previous scores. This one's for the history books.
"

Never been surprised that it is a perfect but already know it had to be
because OF the attachment of the MR Perfect involved. as we all
Christoper Nolan have a history in relationship with Sci-fi movies but
this one take over all of the previous. as history show every movie
breaks the record of the old one.he is running the whole show alone. As
for the movie it is the most amazing approach some one every made on
galaxy and spaces.star cast was amazing for me it is 10 out of 10 in
all accepts. am going to watch this movie again .....lol waiting for
blue-ray to be in my perfect movie collection family.on top of that i
love it
"

I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and
everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I
always thought I would wait for THE movie.And this is IT!When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like
a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it
would become a classic. And I'm sure it will.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so
beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan
decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey
(actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can
feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is
filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual
environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerising. It is a very important part
of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just
found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great
Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot
more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand
how epic they are. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning
atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theatre, and you will be
lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey,
begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I
have never felt something like that in a movie theatre (at least not
for the past ten years).Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I
discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince
me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since
that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I
exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even
unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is
just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very
important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many
different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne
Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create
some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine,
Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The
special guest, I will call him ""X"". His role, which could be seen as a
minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once
again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just
try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionise
everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did
it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionised the superhero genre. With
Interstellar he's revolutionising the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what
I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and
astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it.
During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science
fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is
laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema
is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my
friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some
things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make
the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that
exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about
humanity, about us.Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about
humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly ""X"", will managed to
convince you about that.My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a
beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say ""we
can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare
Nolan to Kubrick"" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people
don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And
Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't
think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie
Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought.

Prior to watching interstellar I was told from various sources 'best
film of the year'. I prefer to not let this distract me when watching a
film and went into the cinema with an open mindset. I must admit I
found the start to be relatively slow paced (which was probably fitting
for the film) however, it did build in such a way I was anxious for it
to 'get to the good stuff'. When Mcconnaughhay first departs for space,
my first thoughts were extremely positive; this is a film which is both
visually and audibly phenomenal adding to the excitement of the
cinematic experience. The story is also good, if not slightly confusing
(and perhaps non-credible at times - particularly towards the end) but
was unpredictable all in all. On several occasions I was on the edge of
my seat biting my nails unsure of what was about to happen. I would
highly recommend this film,to all audiences, especially those with a
passion for space etc. I am,not sure it was 'film of the year' for me
however it was certainly one of the better films I saw last year. 7/10

Have read some of the reviews and decided to write this review to those
who are bickering about the movie. The Movie simply is a product of
imagination and personal view of the subject matter. it doesn't have to
follow the psychics and quantum theory exactly to entertain the
audience. and fellow movie goers i like to tell this as the movie is
just a movie if you don't like it then that's it others might find it
likable. don't try to impose your own feelings and thoughts to others
from watching it. if they decide and watch the movie then that's their
choice. life doesn't reward you for everything you do. if that's your
view then make your own dystopia and produce the movies only for your
self. about the movie review. i liked the movie as it's plot to save
the human kind and it's interstellar voyages. no one has ever done it
and we don't know at best just the speculation of it from the
scientific communities. it's just imaginative and speculative case of
interstellar and what could mean if we achieve such capability.
"
505,10,"
Most Nolan fans - myself included - know that Nolan always has a
powerful opening scene that sets the tone of the movie, and a powerful
closing scene that stays in our memory a long time afterward. The
Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception are all examples of movies that
follow that trend. Interstellar however, slowly builds up the tempo to
a powerful climax reminiscence of TDKR. What this movie has is 'heart',
a lot of it. Not since The Curious Case of Benjamin Button have I shed a tear or
two, but this movie did it. The final scenes had me leaking like a
faulty pipe. Amazing score, amazing story, amazing acting, amazing
visuals. TRUST NOLAN.
"
506,10,"
Ignore the reviews by people confused by science fiction ~ this is an
epic film in every sense. Despite the mindblowing physics on show
(courtesy of science consultant Kip Thorne, no less), Nolan never
forgets to ground the spectacle in human, emotional terms. It is wonderful to go to the cinema and to see a pure, hard SF film
where only a few tweaks have been made for the sake of drama. Like
Kubrick, Nolan knows that no space opera histrionics can compare with
the true terrible and awesome beauty of the raw universe. Like Gravity,
this makes the viewer into an explorer. Couple that with brilliant performances all round and at least one
scene that made me cry and you have that rarest creature: a hard SF
film that also knows how to play emotion. I love that Thorne was also
science consultant on Contact, which starred a young McConaughey. This
time round, he's the explorer. A tour de force from a brilliant, powerful director.

In the near future, climate change takes its toll, slowly but surely
wiping out food crops. An ex NASA pilot Cooper and his daughter Murphy
comes across a gravitational anomaly, which Murphy thought as a ghost.
From one of the anomalies, they get a binary code of a location. They
go there and find that it's a new NASA site. As one of NASA's best,
Cooper is offered a place for the interstellar journey through a black
hole in saving the human race by way of finding a new home, a new
planet, for the whole species. He takes the position, despite Murphy's
disagreement. He goes with Dr. Amanda Brand, Doyle, Romilly, and the
robot TARS. And after fetching the Endurance module and the robot CASE,
they go in through the black hole near Saturn to visit the three
possible new worlds. Brand also experience the 'ghost' as Murphy did.
The first world has a great time-slippage anomaly where an hour spent
there equals roughly seven years on earth. Cooper and Brand argue about
it, he wants to go there to finish the mission fast and go home to
Murphy, while Brand rejects it due to the time slippage. They
eventually go there, but immediately gets swept away by a gigantic
tidal wave. Brand insists on fetching the data pack, thus taking more
time, claiming Doyle's life, temporarily disrupting the lander craft.
Seemingly unaffected, they ultimately return to Romilly, who have aged
23 years due to the time- slippage.Finding the first world a failure, they then go to the second world,
Dr. Mann's world. They find Mann, literally waking him from death in
cryo-stasis. Based on Mann's data, the team decides to continue and set
up a pioneer colony site. But Mann, surrendering to his primal urges,
betray the team in his effort to go back home, killing Romilly while
doing so. Apparently, Mann's data was all lies. He manages to steal one
lander and tries to board the Endurance module as the team gives chase.
But Mann can't dock the lander well. He ends up blowing parts of the
Endurance when he forces to dock. Cooper and Brand manages to reclaim
the Endurance though through a risky stunt. Cooper programs CASE to
steer the Endurance to the third world. But after Brand gets in the
module, Cooper breaks away and sacrifices himself and TARS, after
knowing that the life support can support only one person. Cooper only
inside his space-suit and TARS with him, gets sucked into the Gargantua
black hole. But strangely through the black hole Cooper arrives
floating in a crude space-time continuum that's only limited to the
back side of Murphy's room back in time. He finds out now he is the
Murphy's 'ghost'. He continues on relaying the codes Murphy found in
the past, and also the quantum data TARS collected. After all data is
code-relayed, Cooper gets sucked out of the continuum. He gets picked
up and brought to the space station orbiting Saturn, the human's new
home made with Murphy's data. Cooper comes to and gets reunited with
the now old Murphy.The story is just a great example of how a great and detailed epic can
be told in the modern era. At almost three hours duration, it quite
pushes the boundaries of the contemporary moviegoers' boredom tolerance
level. But the movie is so great that it quite literally nailed me to
the chair, forcing me to hold my bladder almost through the whole third
act LOL. It makes the movie detailed on both the emotional and the
scientific fiction content. Knowing it's another of Christopher Nolan's
sci-fi, I anticipated the movie to be just like The Matrix (1999) and
Inception (2010), which I have to watch more than twice to fully
understand the grand story. But thankfully Sci-Fi is one of my favorite
genres besides Action and Adventure. Thus watching Paycheck (2003), and
other astronauts and time-travel movies really pays off.I really like how the movie really pays attention to making a realistic
depiction of theoretical quantum physics ideas about black holes,
gravitation, time slippage, and ultimately space-time continuum. And
those depictions are really great works. Watching at IMAX 2D, I really
enjoy the journey through the black hole, the giant tidal wave, and
other scenic shots. The movie also takes great advantage of the
consequences of the physics, especially the time slippage and space
travels issues. The scene where Rom aged 23 years in a few hours, the
time-to-time shots of Murphy growing old, the final reunification of
Cooper and Murphy are great scenes that really touches the heart,
though it sure needs a lot of understanding to discern them.The acting overall is one job. Matthew McConaughey did a great job in
both depicting the remorseful father and the calm risk-taker ace pilot.
Anne Hathaway did very good in giving balance to the story, although I
don't think her role is any more significant than that balancing
purposes. Jessica Chastain is also giving great emotional balance to
the other angle of the story. Michael Caine's performance quite
completes the story for a side villain. But actually Matt Damon really
grabs the spot for the complementary villain.My final say is that Interstellar (2014) deserves it's place in the
best movies list everywhere. An 8 out of 10 score is my rating for this
movie. It's indeed a rare find of a gem among today's modern cinema.

Faith and Love can transcend time and space, whether literally or
scientifically. This is what Insterstellar goes out to prove. Faith in
the people we love, in the promises they make, may not be a tangible
thing, however that is what makes us who we are. Although the movie
would be relished more by people having an interest in astrophysics,
still others would love it as much. Mainly because of the way the movie
is presented. The science and human emotions are so tightly
intermingled, that you cannot distinguish one from another. The movie
is not just about a scientific exploration but also exploring the human
psyche. How our choices affect our loved ones? How true it is that the
farther you go from your loved ones the closer you feel to them? In
Interstellar Nolan tests the limits of human spirit, of human
exploration, of human emotions and in this endeavor creates a
masterpiece. The acting is brilliant, so is the screenplay and the
casting. This one is a must watch. For me it is the best movie of this
genre. Cheers, Sushant

The much-anticipated Interstellar arrived and immediately created
massive explosions, both on film and in the film's response. Many, like
myself, found it to be an unprecedented masterpiece. Others have called
the film too outlandish or ridiculous, due to its fictitious scientific
perspectives.This, of course, also happened with last year's space thriller
Gravity-and please take note, Interstellar is not Gravity. It is
undeniable that both are true spectacles to watch, but Interstellar is
a much more philosophical and emotional film. It is a surreal journey
out of our galaxy and feels vividly alive, all while making you
contemplate the realities of humanity and the spectrum of emotions we
experience, such as love and how its manner of existence cannot be
measured in scientific terms. That being said, Interstellar is a very scientific film, yet it is one
that brilliantly manages to balance out with emotional character
development and astounding space cinematography. It can feel stark or
it can feel mind-bending, and its transitions are superbly executed.
Spectacular cinematography and original storytelling come as no
surprise when watching a film directed by Christopher Nolan, best known
for Inception and the Dark Knight trilogy. His entire filmography is
astounding and highly recommended (by me, of course), so those hyped
for the film due to his involvement flocked to the theatre-along with
Matthew McConaughey's huge fan-base since what has been labeled the
McConaissance. A ridiculous term, yes, but let's be thankful he's gone
from bad rom-coms to the dramatic roles he's thrived in, from Mud to
Dallas Buyers Club.The fact of the matter is, as a piece of cinema, Interstellar stands
out. It has many odes to 2001: A Space Odyssey and even Star Wars, due
to Nolan's love for sci-fi. However, much unlike these films,
Interstellar remains grounded outside of alien life. Whether
Interstellar dabbles into the supernatural is cause for debate, due to
the film's scientific presentation mixed with fiction. This is
precisely why Interstellar is an unprecedented experience. It presents
real scientific facts and asks tough philosophical questions, yet
remains a grippingly lucid sci-fi film.Discussing Interstellar feels much like presenting someone with a gift
and not wanting to give any hints as to what it is. The film's layers
are cleverly peeled off and its progression is so beautifully carried
out that there is truly nothing like experiencing it and absorbing its
concepts and theories after it is over. I suppose I've delayed
discussing Interstellar's plot because it is a film in which every plot
point is important and imaginative, and giving anything away would feel
like giving away a meaningful piece. I will, nevertheless, present you
with an introduction and very minor synopsis of the film.Interstellar follows Cooper, played by McConaughey, living with his
father-in-law, son, and daughter, in a desolate Earth filled with
extreme dust storms. Homes and human lungs are filled with dust as
people struggle to survive with limited resources in a deteriorating,
and depleting Earth. Cooper is a farmer who once flew for NASA before
the Earth's descent, and his crops-along with crops around the entire
globe-are dying due to the earth's excessive drought and dust plagues.
Upon making entirely unexpected discoveries, Cooper is faced with
making the difficult decision of leaving his family for the exploration
of planets sustainable of human life in a galaxy outside of our own.
With the spectacular Anne Hathaway at his side, not to mention a
sarcastic clunky robot, Interstellar becomes a humorous experience as
much as it is intellectually stimulating and incredibly moving. This is
a film that simply cannot be missed due to its intricacy, beauty, and
manner of evoking a response from all those who experience it.
"

Let me just say that Christopher Nolan has really stepped up and has
made a beautiful yet epic film that corresponds love, friendship and
survival all in one great piece of work.Matthew McConaughey is one of my favourite actors in recent years and
he plays a great role and executes it perfectly. The story is solid and
the whole space time warp is such an amazing concept and it really does
make you think about it, not just during but after the film as well.It takes about 15-20 minutes for the film to really get going but once
it does, you are sucked into the story and from there onwards it just
speaks for itself. A great film to go and see which I highly recommend.An Oscar contender no doubt.
"
511,10,"
Believe me, the 169 minutes you spent for this movie will never be
considered wasted!! The film will raise many questions, which is
obvious.Christopher Nolan made this film movie excellently. It stars
Matthew McConaughey as Coop, a widowed farmer and father of two. He
lives in a near-future where regular dust storms leave every surface
coated in sand and where a mystery 'blight' is wiping out the world's
crops one by one. It's a future which is much more chilling than the
standard sci-fi wasteland, simply because it is much more recognizable:
society is still functioning, most of the technology is familiar, but
humanity doesn't have many years left. You aren't watching it, you're
experiencing it!

Christopher Nolan excels again with a truly challenging, emotional and
visually stunning piece of work. Interstellar is by far his most
ambitious film and a fascinating journey through time and space. It's
not only a film about exploring the unknown, but it also shows our
unrelenting will to survive in the face of extinction. I was often
completely enthralled by the mystery, visual splendor and really strong
performances from its talented cast. Interstellar is packed with
touching moments and everyone gives their best efforts here in order to
make them feel quite endearing and genuine. In addition, there are many
intriguing surprises along the way and some really thrilling situations
that will leave you in a state of awe. The only aspects of the film
that prevented me from giving it a full rating are the ending and
score. While I appreciate how everything tied together by the end, I
would have preferred to see something more audacious and ambiguous for
this type of movie. Hans Zimmer is a very talented composer and his
work here is quite inspiring, but the score seemed a bit repetitive as
well as unpolished at times. Interstellar is one of the most
astonishing sci-fi films I've seen, being a very unique experience and
a total feast for the senses.
"
513,10,"
A Sci-Fi addiction and can be watched time and again.Interstellar, as the name suggests, describes a futuristic ambition of
humanity in search of habitable planets far across the other side of
the galaxy. Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway beautifully played as astronomers
who, for the sake of survival of humanity, venture into the wormhole.
What follows next is what they didn't expect.The movie is not just a Sci-Fi description of the black holes and their
interaction with material bodies but also a beautiful portrayal of the
deep human emotions to achieve the most impossible feat.

Let's face it, the story is very bad, though it is based on a lot of
real scientific theories like the relativity theory of Albert Einstein,
there are lots of gaps and holes, I will not speak about these holes to
not spoil the fun of watching the film, but when you do watch it, you
will know what I'm talking about, some of these holes are covered by
great directional techniques. (1/4) Christopher Nolan like always did a
great job, the cinematics and visual effects are excellent, I think he
is the one that should take all the credit, it's what he's done that
made this film succeed. (3/3) Acting was better than I expected, I have
always loved Matthew McConaughey and his Texas accent, Anne Hathaway
was perfect too, rest of the cast wasn't that much good really. (2/3)
Music is incredible, it let me sit on the edge of my seat throughout
the whole movie, Hans Zimmer is really amazing. Overall, I think all
the good features in the movie were wasted on such bad story and worse
ending, anyway if you like science fiction you should watch this, I'm
not sure if you will like it but I'm sure you will enjoy it!

What a beautiful movie about our love for humanity, survival, and for
everything else in between. The movie has a good span of human
characteristics covered, from heroics best to selfish worst, to ""one
for all, all for one"" variety of dramatic plot to keep it interesting.
It shortcuts around the trivia and does not attempt at explaining them.
Instead yields to provide more screen time to the main plot. So to
preempt the critics, although I am sure there are some trivia or
science based things wrong with the movie (as is with all movies, given
the entertainment factor), to me it does not take away from the overall
experience as I can easily look over them while I am captivated by the
main message.With a dense plot that pays homage to theoretical astrophysics and
makes you think and question the art of possible, along with
mesmerizing cinematography, and a musical score to match it all, this
one is going instantly down in the all-time epic Classics category.

Maybe a masterpiece... Personally, I need to watch the movie again and
then probably I will know. For many an awful film, lengthy, mess,
something... There is an insane gap between the reviewers opinions
about this movie.For me, boys and girls, it's just a movie. A lengthy one, yes... but,
still, a movie and kept me watching till the end. Now that I am
thinking of it, I bet Lawrence of Arabia would have been awful and
lengthy for many.So, go and watch it. It is not a masterpiece but you and I may decide
otherwise. It sure needs attention. The connections, many reviewers are
seeking, with the heroes are all there. Perhaps we need to invest more
of our minds and hearts to find them. But the real reason I am writing
this review is the music. Without any doubt, this OST is a masterpiece.
If someone does not get it, in his or her review, I suggest to stop and
go read the next. I do not mind reading the film is awful but I do mind
reading that the soundtrack is. Check your ears, your hearts or your
minds if you believe that. Perhaps try and listen to it again... Hans
Zimmer is a genius and surely one of the greatest composers of our
time.

A film like this asks to be criticized at every step of the way, and
for me, not one of the best films of the year, but one of the greatest
films of all time, every element works seamlessly: music, visual
effects, sound effects, but the script and the performances need to be
hailed individually.....Performances by Matthew McConaughey, Anne
Hathaway, Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain are perfect....but the script
is glorious as every single one written by these two brothers, not a
single loose end.....I can almost guess what part of the movie was the
one that some movie critics were not thrilled about, but makes perfect
sense if you have at least once heard about some of the Nolan film.
There are moments of this movie that are said to be "" extremely
scientific"", but I think what really happen was that, some of the
critics are not used to be mentally challenged like this....it's not a
quantum physics lecture throughout the movie, just the right amount of
science necessary to understand the film's initial plot.....I hope the
award season brings this masterpiece to it's deserved spot, side by
side with other fantastic films released this year, that don't come
close to match Christopher Nolan's achievements, if Gravity pulled that
much attention....Interstellar should to...

In 1968 I seen 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY my first thought was ""What the
Hell"" it made no sense. Then as time went on after a few more viewings
and a reading of the book it all came together it made perfect sense it
was so obvious it was right there in front of me why could I not see it
/ It was Stanley Kubrick's Masterpiece.My personal favorite film of all
time. Yesterday I seen Christopher Nolan's INTERSTELLAR my first
thought was the exact same ""What the Hell"" it made no sense. Let's not
get ahead of ourselves I don't want to put INTERSTELLAR on the same
level with 2001 just yet but it does have the potential to reach those
lofty heights. One of Nolan's previous films INCEPTION also was as Lou
Umenick says in his New York Post review of INTERSTELLAR"" Nolan still
makes wholly original movies that require audiences to pay close
attention and think"" Interstellar does require both. In it's 169
minutes Interstellar has human interest stories of love, trust,
promises, bad guys good guys and most of all Worm Holes, Black Holes,
The Space Time Continuum, Physics and Relativity. It would help a great
deal if you posses a degree in Quantum Mechanics from Oxford to
understand some of the hi tech jargon on the theory of Relativity. But
don't let that stop you this film is Awesome go see it then go see it
again and again and once you do get it let me know. just what the hell

Christopher Nolan's ninth film (including Following, as I do),
Interstellar was released today and I just had to go see it. And was I
pleased? Kinda, yeah. I'm a HUGE Nolan fan. I really like all of his films; he's my favourite
film director and he even happened to make my all-time personal
favourite film, Inception back in 2010. So there's a lot for me to
expect from him.Interstellar was the Nolan film I'd been waiting for for quite some
time now. Knowing he always cites Star Wars: A New Hope and 2001: A
Space Odyssey as some of his favourite films and biggest inspirations
made me want him to try doing something like this himself. And he
finally did!I did really, really, really enjoy the film. Nolan knows how to hold
the audience no matter what. It's interesting throughout, compelling,
occasionally tense and quite emotional at points. I thought that
Matthew McConaughey did an excellent job (one of my favourite roles in
a Nolan film thanks to him)! The score from Hans Zimmer is arguably one
of his best (and that's saying a lot!). It's also very visually pretty
(some nice cinematography from Nolan's new cinematographer at times).
The concept is clever and is executed nicely, but I do feel it does
fall apart at times - maybe trying a little too hard... At points I
felt it was trying to be this generation's 2001 a little too much, but
it didn't bother me all that much. It is nice to see such an ambitious film in such a way that it
obviously has had a lot of time and care put into it. It really shows.
I still hold by my opinion that Nolan is yet to make a bad film. It
just isn't AS great as some of his previous works in my opinion. Overall rating: 7.4/10 (may change depending on second viewing
thoughts).
"
520,7,"
The enormous ambition and downright grandeur is admirable, in a film
that at times leaves us pinned to our seats with intensity, or dealing
with strong emotional quandaries at others. The feeling of mystery and
exploration towards the unknown - wormholes and black holes, are
exercises that have never been made in cinema with this degree of
scientific approach while displaying them on the big screen with such
visual splendour.Unfortunately, Nolan fails to deliver a deserving finale at the scale
of the whole interstellar voyage. Unwinding itself in scientific
explanations (Nolan already had the bad habit of providing
over-exposition through some of the characters) - which ends up
mitigating the whole sense of mystery and subjectiveness; otherwise
imagine a ""2001: Space Odyssey"" where all the characters would be
constantly explaining in detail everything that was going on; this
excess of exposition contrasts with the convenient lack of plausible
science in some moments of the movie, which causes the plot to lose
consistency.On the other hand, although Nolan manages to give a strong emotional
side of the film's protagonists, he ""forgets"" to give any character
development to some of the non-leads, being completely insensible
towards them in some moments and losing, once again, consistency.
Moreover, while some of the characters seem to be present only to serve
as ""how-to manuals"" and exposition, the one that displays more
""humanity"" in terms of dialogue is arguably a robot...The final act of the movie was... a mess. I was stunned, but mostly not
for good reasons, and found myself thinking more than once: ""are you
kidding me?"".But I can honestly say I liked the movie, overall. It is a very
interesting story; very intense, mainly thanks to moments similar to
what we've seen in Cuarón's ""Gravity""; a sense of exploration and
mankind pushing boundaries, as we've experienced in Kubrick's ""2001"";
and a plot that might share too many resemblances with... ""Knowing""
(Alex Proyas, 2009), but this one is not a compliment!Definitely worth seeing at a movie theatre, but that you already knew!

edit: no idea why this review is so unpopular. I loved Interstellar, I
loved 2001: A Space Odyssey, but find 2001 too glacial and was
impressed by the amount of pathos Nolan provided in this genre. Yes,
HAL is an incredible character, like a spurned lover, but I'm never
moved like I was while watching Interstellar.-BenA great director tries his hand at a space epic and the results are
remarkable.Thematically, the film is mindblowing; theatrically, the film is
mindblowing. There are echoes of Kubrick's 2001, but this time with
feeling. There is humour, pathos and incredible scenes of technical
wizardry. Special effects sure have come a long way since 2000's The
Perfect Storm. The scene featuring the large ""mountains"" was
incredible.Incredible performances, characters you care about, a long movie that
will grab hold of you through its entire length. Matthew McConaghey is
great. He is a far more likable and human figure than Di Caprio was in
Inception. I'd rank this up with Memento as Nolan's greatest
achievement. Great to see him have the time to solve the space epic.10/10
"

i think Matthew McConaughey is great actor and he's good acting in this
movie but maybe it could be better with Keanu reeves. The Movie has
better Soundrack than Contents like inception. but people think
interstellar is best movie that they saw ever.that's not true. thats
why Christopher Nolan is best in him area.The best movie in this year
was whiplash and not Birdman this is my opinion. the movie of all time
is of course The Shawshank Redemption and godfather, godfather II is't
as good as part i but All right. imitation game another English movie.

I watched this in large part hoping it would emphasize climate change
and other human failings, but it did so in only a vague way, and
stressed the point that Man is an ""explorer"" more than a ""caretaker.""I found it odd that they put a scientist named Mann on a frozen planet
and had him fake data, which seemed like a jab at a famous
climatologist pilloried by right-wingers. Are film-makers so cynical
and profit-driven that they have to appease every element of society?I found the plot-line ponderous in many scenes, with temporary
confusion about who was on what ship as they scouted out the planets.
The guy who aged 23 years while they mucked around in the water wasn't
explained very well. Did he go into hibernation? Otherwise, how did he
not deplete their food supply?Other notable flaws were: Driving through a corn field to chase a drone
with no fear of damaging the truck, let alone even seeing the drone
with corn that high, and using a laptop to boot. Then he lets his
daughter land the drone on her first try as if it's just a toy he was
chasing. Too many cutesy Hollywood tactics. The blocky metal robots
seemed fragile and impractical for getting around a physical
environment. I guess the metal was impervious to damage somehow. They
also pegged the Earth's population at 6 billion but it's well over 7
now. Unclear when all the action was going down.The redeeming part of the film was its clever time travel aspect. All
in all, I wasn't overly impressed but it kept me entertained. The
concept could have been executed a lot better with the same basic
storyline.
"
524,10,"
If you are open minded and embrace the idea that ""anything is possible""
you will absolutely love this film. The film portrays elements of the
universe we are yet to explore and may never do so, yet still manages
to deliver it with credibility.I cannot remember the last time I watched a movie which effected me
emotionally and physically, I was close to tears at certain points
(Message From Home) and on the edge of my seat at others (Imperfect
Lock) I can only assume this is created by Nolan's sheer genius and how
he effortlessly makes the unknown seem tangible.The soundtrack is what really differentiates Interstellar from other
films in its genre, maybe I am biased towards Hans Zimmer as he is the
greatest film composer of our time, his record doesn't lie... Pirates
of the Caribean, 12 Years a Slave, Inception, The Amazing Spiderman 2,
Black Hawk Down, Gladiator, The Dark Knight, The Lion King....to name a
few. Each scene title is depicted in a way that only a master of his
craft could create, I purchased the album and in all seriousness I
cannot fault a single track.Overall I was blown away by everything in this film from visual
effects, performances, soundtrack and most importantly the emotive
atmosphere. Yes there may have been some errors and there may have been
holes (no pun intended) in certain areas, but lets remember its 2015
and the human race is yet to explore that deep into space. Once we
enter the year 3000 and ""we live underwater"" I am sure people will
laugh at the nonsensical way this film has been created, but until that
time I would suggest you go to see this film as it was highly
enjoyable! ""Do not go gentle into that good night""
"
525,10,"
Interstellar was stellar on so many levels. It gave much to ponder and
reflect upon. I write this as review of the film from a biblical
worldview, which I believe can be done with integrity and without
compromising the meanings of the film. First, there is a world in need.
Then, a savior is chosen. There is a longing to go, see, discover and
save, innate in this chosen savior. He leaves his home to journey to
another world to save the world. Then, for me at least, greater
connections begin. There is a wormhole. This shows us a glimpse of God
in Scripture, as in Psalms 90:4 - ""a thousand years in your sight are
but as yesterday when it is past"" or 2 Peter 3: 8 - ""with the Lord one
day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."" We arrive
on Planet 1 - a world of water. It brought to mind Genesis 1: 2 where
""the earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of
the deep."" Water is the source of life, yet death comes on this planet.
We go to Planet 2 - a frozen world, an age of ice. There is no life
here. It brought to mind Sheol, the place of the dead. Here, resides an
enemy, yet it is a fallen man, a trickster, one who masquerades in the
light. This man was once the hero of many. Now he has become corrupted
and become a living death. The savior then begins to save. The fallen
man, the trickster, is defeated. Yet there is a greater salvation in
the sacrifice our savior brings. He gives of himself, he lays down his
life for his friend, falling into darkness itself, a black hole. He
goes into ultimate darkness. And it is there, that his transformation
takes on greater shape. A resurrection begins. He makes his true
discoveries. That true life exists outside the boundaries of space and
time. That the further we go out, the further we go in to discover true
love. The love of a father for his child. That the father will do
whatever it takes, to cross space and time to reach and connect with
his child. And that this is possible. In this we can discover many
things for our own lives. We can journey to try to touch the face of
God in the cosmos, yet we see this most clearly in love for another
human being. We can witness, the story of the Bible, God's love for us
in crossing across time, space, flesh, and death itself to come to us,
communicate with us. At the end of Interstellar, our savior hero is not
old, his flesh has not begun to decay. It is as if he is reborn. He has
new life. The purpose and the journey continue. A new adventure begins.
Restoration has happened; it is a new world. Interstellar, I believe,
shows well in a movie, the biblical story of creation, fall,
redemption, and restoration. And it is very good. And there is so much
more one could take out of this film. A great story reflecting the
Greatest Story.

I'm probably not the target audience for the freres Nolan as I tend to
notice things instead of being seduced. Take the opening. We're in East
Jesus in the heart of the dust bowl. An ordinary family, a wooden home
one step up from a tarpaper shack. Inside an equally ordinary kitchen
THEN, in the bedroom of the daughter of the house, Murph, we find
FLOOR-TO-CEILING BOOKSHELVES? Fully stocked. You're putting me on,
right, Chris. More? Seems the father of Murph is an ex pilot who has
retired to become a farmer. No real problem there BUT, he and Murph
stumble on some co-ordinates and follow them to a top-secret NASA base
where the head honcho is Professor Michael Caine. They show the
intruder the latest space-ship, explain that earth is running out of
food and the only solution is to find a planet that will sustain human
life AND THEN invite him to lead the mission. This is a guy who hasn't
flown in x amount of years and may or may not be in shape. There is no
training programme, no vetting, the whole thing resembles a car
salesman offering someone who walks in off the street a chance to test
drive the latest top-of-the-range Lamborghini. If you can get past this
nonsense you may well enjoy what follows. Unlike, say, Gravity, which
was virtually one hundred per cent in space, Intersteller does
introduce a human element and is all the better for it. Clearly the
Nolans are interested in exploiting technology at the expense of
constructing an even halfway plausible screenplay and there are
probably enough overgrown schoolboys out there who will respond to cgi
the way Pavlov's dog responded to a bell.
"
528,8,"
Interstellar gets you thinking about lots of things, mostly those lost
opportunities and the regrets you have from NOT doing what you wanted
to when you could do it. In that vein, the bending of time that takes
place throughout the movie gives you plenty of ways to be
introspective, and maybe even have a second chance.Enter Matt Mcconaughy as the somewhat frustrated lead, Cooper, who is a
farmer on a dying planet, instead of a jet pilot, which he is trained
to do. He's raising two young kids on his own, Murph being the most
visible, and actually a brilliant young mind. His son Tom seems more
obedient and is ready to take over the household when Coop gets sent on
a mission to save humanity. Professors Brand (father and daughter) are played by Michael Caine and
Annie Hathaway, are terrific. The acting in general is strong. The
movie is almost 3 hours long but it moves along quickly.Throughout the mission, you wonder if they will find the new planet,
what is going on back on earth, what year is it back on earth (because
gravity does some incredible warping and compressing of time it seems).
You need to suspend reality as you watch this movie, and think, OK,
well, that's cool.In the end, this movie neatly combines human emotions, hope, family,
with technical wizardry and excellent storytelling to deliver a
must-see movie that will inspire deep emotions in you. Enjoy.

Well done filming and soundtrack score. I appreciate how real this is
or can be. Open minded to the possibility this may or is happening. Its
a reality check for all to interpret. I've watched it many times now.
First time i missed some because i was more interested,involved with
the plausible,hypothetical scientific theories, second time i payed
more attention to dialogue, family dynamics,and it all clicked
together. The third time watching it remembering all the previous
viewings together made a much more comprehensible and meaningful
complete viewing. Not to mention that any film that's two plus hours
long one tends to get fixated and wander a bit. love how it reminds me
how vulnerable, small and self righteous we mankind are. another
favourite..

+ Cinematography: It's a visual treat. The depiction of space travel
couldn't get any more beautiful than this.+ The Science: Some really good scientific thought has gone into the
making of this film. This is enough to assure the audiences that
Interstellar isn't just another run-of-the-mill sci-fi movie.+ Story: While this concept has been tested previously by a lot of
films, Interstellar has managed to pull off the human extinction theory
with relative ease.- Length: The screenplay has been accused of being on the slower side
throughout and with good reason. Interstellar drags on quite a bit and
could have done with a better pair of scissors.- Performances: Hammy to say the least. Every character has done it.
Not very Nolan-like but there's a first time for everything.- Preachy script: Almost every character gets preachy about love and
other things which gets irritating after a point.After the outstanding ending to the Dark Knight trilogy, Nolan has yet
again come back with something brilliant. Set in the not-so-distinct
future, Interstellar is a tale of a holocaust-like human situation
where crops have started dying and there's a fear of the extinction of
the human race as we know it. A team of astronauts headed by Cooper
(Matthew McConaughey), Dr. Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Doyle (Wes
Bentley), and Romilly (David Gyasi) go on a journey that transcends
galaxies with the help of a worm hole that has been suspected to be
placed by some unknown alien life form.Interstellar also depicts the relationship between Cooper and his
estranged daughter Murph (played incredibly by Mackenzie Foy as a child
and Jessica Chastain as the adult.) The film tries to delve into love
as the most primal form of human emotion. While at that, it often gets
a little preachy with the same.Hans Zimmer's score is hauntingly beautiful as it get the viewers
engage in the movie experience like never before.The climax is totally unexpected and has been brilliantly treated. Save
for some plot holes, Interstellar largely manages to give the viewers a
visual experience of a lifetime. Perhaps the greatest aspect of the
film is that it is backed up by real science and theories that exist.
Interstellar is a true blue sci-fi that more than respects the genre.
"

This movie is very powerful and emotional. It's feature realistic
theories about space, father-children relation, exploring and
preservation of the human race. Without spoiling anything, yes the end
can be confusing but if you paid attention to the movie you should
understand it. The movie made me wonder if we could really settle on
other planets. The theories about space exploring in the movies are so
realistic that it's nearly impossible to know if it's true. In
conclusion, I think it is the best science-fiction movie of all time
for all the reasons above and I recommend everyone who are science-
fiction fan or simple interested by space to watch it.
"
532,10,"
I went to the movies to see this film with no expectations at all. I
only knew that it takes place mostly in space and that it has something
to do with saving the Earth. In the first half an hour I became aware
how strange and original this movie is going to be. The script is very
original, the interpretation of everything that surrounds us is so
unique and interesting that after the movie ended I was like ""How could
anyone come up with something like this?"" I don't know if anyone could
watch this film without being emotionally involved, invested and
connected with the characters. Matthew McConaughey surprised me with
his acting skills, I think he definitely deserves at least an Golden
globe nomination for this role.
"

Stellar cast, great performances by all of the actors involved. Leading
with the incredible Matthew McConaughey. Who together push your
emotional buttons to the edge. Watching this movie had my eyes watering
up and the palm of my hands sweating. It's an intense movie.The story about a retired engineer and pilot leaving our planet for a
greater cause works out perfectly. Making it relatable for most.
Beautiful scenery and great cinematography throughout the movie. I loved it, however. This movie will not be for everyone. Some people
had problem with the pacing of the movie. Personally, I had no issue
with the lenght of the movie and would even want it to be longer. I
think the movie might be hard to grasp and comprehend for some, might
need some explanation to fully understand it. People who are interested
in the concept of space exploration will love this movie. It answers
questions and gives thought-provoking imaginations of our world. The
movie have a very inspiring message and no one can deny that the movie
makes you think.Watch it! Highly recommend it. If you like the genre, you will love it.
If you don't like sci-fi then you might not enjoy it as much, but there
is things in the movie for you too.

""We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the
impossible. And we count these moments these moments when we dared to
aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the
'unknown' known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements.
But we lost all that or perhaps we've just forgotten that we are still
'pioneers'. And we've barely begun And that our greatest
accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our 'destiny' lies above
us.""INTERSTELLAR travel  a journey of exploration of spaces ""situated in
stars"". However, the literal meaning falls short of summarizing the
happening of an entire film that is been deemed as 'paradigm shifting
cinematic phenomenon' worldwide by viewers, critics and (most of the)
scientists alike. Toying with the idea of 'we didn't inhabit Earth to stay, but to leave
it someday'  this science-fiction drama tried to browse through the
possibility that ""end of Earth, shall not be the end of mankind"" for
which a team of space-explorers travel from the degrading Earth through
a 'wormhole to find a potentially habitable planet that could sustain
humanity', with the help of futuristic artificial intelligence based
robots and neo-designed space-ships.Lauded by many and criticized by several for crossing the logics and
reasoning too many times, this film reminds us of an inherent ability.
To re-quote Gerry Spence, ""I would rather have a mind opened by wonder
than one closed by belief."" The choice shall be rested on individual
judgments. There is no surprise that this film would have been eventually made by
Nolan himself, looking at his history of films like - ""Following"",
""Memento"", and ""Inception"". It won't be an exaggeration to call him a
""wizard"". As with every Christopher Nolan film, the ""possibilities"" are
explored and tested in a fashion as if it is not a piece of art, rather
a medium of simulation to verify and validate those possibilities, and
still a viewer leaves the theater with doubts on conclusion and ends up
with a more personalized understanding of the entirety. Even an engineering graduate like me felt his brain in ""over-drive""
post-viewing this two and-a-half-hour long film, where a problem of
future human survival was ably defined, described and possibly solved
through the Astrophysical hypotheses and theories. Jonathan Nolan
proves to be a very resourceful screenwriter to have etched out such a
plot and story out of theories based on and suggested by works of
Theoretical Physicist, Kip Thorne, who also served as an Executive
Producer to the film.The most brilliant works done on the film  VFX (supervised by Paul
Franklin; 'The Dark Knight Trilogy') to go par ""make believe"" and
actually ""make us believe"" in the possibilities of something that might
happen (or might just happen) in distant future; Music, by Hans Zimmer,
depicting ominous grandeur and solitude that not only enhanced the
vastness of the portrayed outer-space but also, touched the viewer to
the core becoming the part of their 'memories'; Sound Design
(supervised by Academy Award winner Richard King) and Editing (Lee
Smith; ""The Dark Knight"") were an integral part of backbone of the
film; and so was its engaging Cinematography (Hyote van Hoytema;
""Her"").Amongst the cast, Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathway are indeed
brilliant (especially the former) and gently remind their previous
Oscar wins. Jessica Chastain, Mckenzie Foy, Michale Caine  play their
supporting parts most emphatically. Guest appearances by Casey Affleck
and Matt Damon were quite surprising yet, done well.To conclude, the film even with its jargon-heavy second-half doesn't
pull down the spirits, and could even be enjoyed for a second time
especially by our ""astronomy aficionados"". This film, being helmed as a
milestones after works like  ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Avatar"", ""Life
of Pi"", ""Gravity"", etc.  is in the most simple words  ""believable;
even when it's not"". A 9-rating for its pioneering brilliance and the
sheer beauty of the Nolan-style of storytelling.

When I review a sci-fi thriller the utmost goal of the film is all
about keeping the crowd on the train at all times. When I saw this film
on the big screen, I could not help but be immediately drawn into the
plot of the story-line. This is for certain Christopher Nolan's
prominent piece. The acting was top notch, as expected. However even in
the case of a Sci-Fi Thriller, there must always be a fill in the gap.
After all, in the definition of a Sci-Fi ""never rationalize"", we must
take into consideration the mix with Thriller which is the heart and
soul of this film. There was a fairly unlikable taste to the beginning
scene of apocalyptic scenario where the crop has failed. Not bad, but
just not emotive, the more the movie progresses the more you feel like
your ""interstellar"". Which symbolizes the obvious success of a big time
film. Hence my two favorite thrillers, ""Inception"", and ""Interstellar"".
Finally ending a short but concise review, you may ask these questions,Is this the greatest of sci-fi thrillers? No. Close, but No. Is this the greatest of space sci-fi? Perhaps. Very stunning design and
CGI.Will this movie rock my world? It certainly will, unless you have bad
taste in film.Is it realistic? Absolutely, despite most physics laws crushing every
concept except taking off in a rocket. You must always keep your logic
""outside of the movie"" if you are ever to enjoy anything the sci-fi
world has to offer.So In conclusion, its the greatest In my book, hopefully many simple
minded critical individuals will think the same, because it truly is a
fresh, Interstellar masterpiece.

This is the best movie i have ever seen besides 'Thin red line' .Not only the concept but also the acting and special effect just
unbelievable . Then music by Hans zimmer is out of this planet . I
almost cried at the last seen . In the beginning i was not very
comfortable but as the time progresses i got into the movie and at the
last fifteen to twenty minutes i just had no word to describe it .
Cristopher you rock ! One after another you are giving us your best
shots . Bat man , inception now this epic movie but i think this one is
the best of all . Now if i come to the acting part all of them were so
natural specially Matthew and sir Michele Kene and also Anne , Jessica
, Macaenzy , Topher i have no Words . I just want to say thank you
Christopher for this movie . You are one of the best for a long time
and i wish you will be continue to do so . This is way better than
'2001' by the way i think .

Having waited for several months for the release of Interstellar, and
being excited by many of the factors revealed before the release, i.e.
McConaughey starring, Nolan directing, and of course Hans Zimmer again
composing the score. There were so many different things to be excited
about, and whilst many people have been disappointed by Interstellar, I
think Nolan has created perhaps his best achievement to date. There is
not a single aspect of Interstellar that I can describe as less then
amazing. In fact, I think it even eclipses the Dark Knight; despite a
truly spellbinding performance like Heath Ledger, I felt that the star-
studded cast put on nothing less than a truly emotional, captivating
performance. McConaughey put in another brilliant performance that have
we have become more recently acquainted with, Anne Hathaway again
provides a strong supporting performance along with Jessica Chastain/
Mackenzie Foy as Murph. The most surprising however was Matt Damon's
brief appearance; his character provided a strong antagonist basis in a
fell that was already so emotional, and Nolan really captured the
feelings of a human at his lowest point. Again there has to be a huge
amount of credit given to Hans Zimmer, who again created a fantastic
score for a film that was rounded off perfectly with the use and
sometimes disuse of sound. The score perfectly captured the emotional
backdrop of the film and the silence in space created a perfect
surrounding and allowed the audience to immerse itself in the film more
deeply. The ending in itself actually rounds the film off perfectly,
and without any spoilers, actually made total sense and despite
criticism, I think Nolan has rounded off his masterpiece perfectly.
Overall, this in my opinion is one of the greatest pieces of cinema
ever created, and the whole film is truly brilliant, with great
filming, scenery, acting, music and a perfect storyline based on the
works of the genius that is Kip Thorne.

This film should hold the title as one of the best of all time. Up
there with Titanic & Armageddon definitely. The storyline, special
effects, score, and human emotion all contributed to a beautifully told
story. I hope this wins many Oscars: Best film, Best director, Best
Score, Best screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best special effects, Best
supporting actress (Anne Hathaway), Best Actor (Matthew McConaguey),
etc.Overall, I have seen this film four times in theaters, at least once in
Imax. I hope to see it at least a few more times. I would just like to
say terrific work to Christopher Nolan, and ALL of the acting cast.
Myself, and the rest of the audience in the movie theaters, are very,
very amazed by this film. Hopefully, a sequel is in the works!

Great movies are not made every day nor every year, and who knows how
long we will wait to see a movie as good as that one. Interstellar was
perfect in every aspect I could think of. I wanted to know what the
protagonists are going to do yet wanted the movie to stay rolling as
much as possible. All the actors really played their roles perfectly. I
just want to give Academy awards to all of them. Matthew McConaughey is
officially my top favorite actor of all time. I first saw him in
Failure to Launch and I thought he was going to be a mediocre actor.
However, this year I saw him in We are Marshall, Dallas Buyers Club,
True Detective, and now Interstellar, and now I believe he is staying
in Movie History. He succeeds in touching me in every role he plays.
Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, and Jessica
Chastain also played their roles perfectly. Christopher Nolan. I do not
know what to say. One thing I love about his movies is that not a
single frame in the whole movie is useless or irrelevant to the plot of
the movie. Every tiny thing that occurs on the screen is for a reason.
He just succeeds on making me concentrate and leave everything I am
doing to watch the movie. The sound effects and the special effects are
perfect also. The screen writing is beautiful u will never get bored or
feel that the characters are saying weird stuff. All the jokes are in
place. Simply this movie is staying in my memory forever. I am so happy
I had the chance to watch it in Cinema and I think I will go watch it
again. I recommend it to everyone and believe me your mind will be
blown. 2 advice I want to tell you: The first is ;if possible; go to
the movie without watching the trailer and without reading the plot.
This really quadrupled the fun for me. The second is do not go to the
movie if your mind is occupied or distorted cause you may miss a part
in the movie that is essential to the whole movie.Go watch it and have fun.

I was waiting to watch it since the announcement back last year.
Amazing! I feel I could not get all the - substance, - pleasure, - the visual
greatness, - the simple and clever/ironic dialog from the first visit
at cinema. Maybe Captain America or Spider-man fans will give some 6-7 rating, but
be honest. I wish it could be 267 minutes instead of 167.Definitely worth watching more than once.Best of 2014 and recent years. Nolan you're the best! Go and enjoy it
guys.

""I'm not afraid of death.I'm an old physicist-I'm afraid of time.""Magnificent. Fascinating.Absorbing. Breathtaking.Titillating.
Mind-blowing.These are just some of the superlatives that I could think of,after
watching this masterpiece.It doesn't happen to me often that a film
keeps resonating in my mind and I'm still pondering about it after a
while.Not that you have to be puzzled about the mathematical content,
because it's better to forget about that part.The theory of relativity
is brought up once and a while,they end up somewhere in some fifth
dimension and you'll be bombarded with theories about black holes and
wormholes till you get dizzy.There were some things not really clear to
me,but I restrained myself to find plot holes or doubt the accuracy of
some mathematical assumptions.It would be quite pretentious to doubt
certain statements that are thought out by more enlightened spirits
than myself.Although I kind of lacked some imagination in the past to
understand certain axioms from solid geometry.So I still have
difficulties with the proposition that ""two parallel lines intersect
with each other at infinity."" Firstly,I can't imagine the infinite. And
second,those parallel lines will still be parallel even at infinite
distance.No one on earth will ever claim that they do intersect
there,because he once was at that infinite point and saw it with his
own eyes.For me it was totally surreal mathematics,my limited intellect
couldn't grasp.Hence probably that's why I flunked that exam of solid
geometry.But that's beside the point.Nolan managed to make an epic film.A mix of fiction and non-fiction.
The set-up to establish a colony on an unknown planet in another galaxy
(""To boldly go where no man has gone before"" comes spontaneously to
mind) is not really science fiction anymore,given at this time all
preparations are made to try the same thing on Mars.But as they plunge
into the wormhole,after which they'll be teleported to another galaxy,
the non-fiction ends and speculations begin.How it works,is
demonstrated in a playful manner,using a sheet of paper and a pencil.
Just to keep it simple for someone like me and explain it in an
understandable way.But I have to admit that the visualization of this
Utopian trip looks stunning.As a counterpart of this high-tech future
story,there's also the human aspect whereby Cooper (Matthew
McConaughey) has to make a difficult choice between his family and
saving humanity.The space trip is preceded by the melodramatic part of the movie which
I normally would have described as the corny sappy part.But here I
didn't have that feeling at all and the whole was brought well-founded.
The sketched relationship between Cooper,Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and Tom
(Timothée Chalamet) on the dusty ranch,is explained in detail and in a
sound manner.In gloomy conditions they try to grow crops.A project that
is doomed to fail because fungi slowly eats away all crops on our
planet.Cooper,a former astronaut who was employed by NASA,focuses on
the agricultural sector now (because there is a need for the production
of food, and not space experts) and has constructed a fully automated
farm.According to Murph there's a so-called poltergeist who wants to
deliver a message.Because of this phenomenon,they discover a secret
NASA complex run by John Brand (Michael Caine) who explains to Cooper
his exodus theory and asks him to lead this exodus as pilot of the
intergalactic spaceship ""Endurance"".Usually the soundtrack of a film leaves me Siberian cold. But in
""Interstellar"" the composer Hans Zimmer created a perfect atmosphere
with his compositions. Cooper leaving his family wouldn't be so
impressive with the supporting organ sounds missing. Knowing Nolan you
can also assume that the appearance of the film would be impressive.
And it is. The interior of the Endurance, the landscapes of the three
planets, the images of infinite space, the black hole Gargantua, the
presentation of the fifth dimension and the trip through the black
hole. It all looked very impressive and realistic. Nolan is also known
as a supporter of limited-use-of-CGI and it wouldn't surprise me if
they made use of huge settings interspersed with tiny elaborated scale
models. The planet Miller I personally found the most successful and
imaginary result. And finally I just like to mention the accompanying
robots TARS and CASE. An innovative design with a humorous
communication interface.What remains are the performances, with Matthew McConaughey as main
figure. After seeing him at work in ""The Lincoln Lawyer"", ""Mud"" and
""Dallas Buyers Club"" (for which he won an Oscar), you can only agree
that McConaughey is a talented actor with a peculiar accent who leaves
a mark on each film. Personally, I think ""Interstellar"" isn't his most
impressive rendition. Yes, he's cut out for the emotion-rich family
parts, but as an intellectual NASA astronaut I found him quite
implausible. In contrast, I thought Jessica Chastain (as the adult
Murph) and Anne Hathaway (daughter of Professor Brand) acted excellent.
Casey Affleck (adult Tom), Topher Grace (Murph colleagues and for the
umpteenth time in a fairly geeky role) and Matt Damon appear only
briefly and each with a different important contribution. The only one
who really should feel at home in this film is John Lithgow, for his
participation in ""3rd Rock from the Sun"".I could repeat the superlatives I wrote down at the beginning because
despite some developments that went beyond my understanding and an
ending I wasn't impressed by, this is still a wonderful film that
manages to blend both the scientific and the personal feelings of the
protagonists perfectly. I'm still wondering who ultimately planted that
wormhole near Saturn, that fifth dimension still goes over my head and
how Cooper finally succeeded in sending the right information needed to
Murph also seemed quite an achievement. And posturing about love as
something scientific that knows no boundaries, was also an excuse to
give it all a deeper philosophical tone. But ultimately, this is
another SF that can be included in the gallery of all those other
masterpieces.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be

I felt I had to open an INDB account just to review this amazing movie
that was mesmerising. The film was simply WOW and had me thinking of
the possibilities for days after and I will certainly be adding this to
my top 10 DVD collection and be watching again. The visuals, story,
music were all amazing and the acting sublime, the whole cast were
amazing. This is the best film I have seen in many years and I would
recommend it to anybody and trust me when I tell you this is a
masterpiece.Some of the negative reviews on here I cant quite believe and these
people must be action Expendables fans is all that I can say, as if
they cant appreciate a film as amazing as this one then what hope is
there. This film deserves an Oscar and Christopher Nolan excels himself once
more and is a true genius in cinema.A MUST SEE FILM

Everything I wanted out of a sci fi movie, a great story grounded in
scientific as we understand it today, pushing the boundaries of human
ingenuity, hope and desperation. The movie it breathtakingly beautiful to look at, the visuals never
cease to amaze. Their attention to detail and the artistic choices they
made to represent their travel through the wormhole, to another
universe, past a black hole and into the tesseract at the end was
great, as they had to represent a 4/5 d space on a 2d screen.The characters were great, the best of them being the robots. TARS and
his cohorts are more along the lines of a true estimation on how
sentient(ish) robots will be in the future.

The first few times i watched this movie it was a bit confusing. But
after watching it some times i realized how good this movie is. The
screenplay is just amazing and so is the plot. It contains so much to
think about, so many things to wonder about. The only confusion is in
the end about the dimensions, but it is understandable, especially if
you go on the internet and read some about it. It is exciting to see
how they portray a black hole and a wormhole, even when there are no
real photos of them. This is a must see, just amazing. So stop
scrolling 9GAG and START WATCHING THIS MOVIE... Cause you will regret
it if you don't, you wont realize what you are missing. One thing i
cant get to understand is why this movie isn't at a higher rating. Cant
really locate the bad things about this movie.

epic movie, the movie as a whole is so awesome it's so beautifully and
artsy shot! the plot is amazingly amazing, the space scenes and the
environment are astonishingly gorgeous and the drama in the movie is so
beautifully affectionate and touching, some scenes are so interestingly
thrilling but certain points are so SCI-FI for me to understand I could
barely figure them out I enjoyed every single detail in the movie
though! don't know I just love and so much! I highly recommend it, it's
a must see, the 3 hours is seriously worth the watch you find yourself
involved and focused all the time so you don't feel the time running
out. Mathew McConaughy and Anne Hathaway did a great job, their
performances are superb. Finally, the directing is incredible.

so, why 1/10 ... because this one is not Sci-Fi !!! Plot have huge
amount of 'black holes' )) This movie is OUT of physics and is NOT even
close to Einstein theories. It's fantasy for kids. Funny part about
time travel & x5 dimensions is bullshit: - even u can travel in time
mentioned with some stupid way using gravity as x5 dimension to change
future (holly crap) - U SHOULD REPEATED IT EVERY NANO SECONDS to KEEP
expected future not change back - BUT, butterfly effect DOES NOT exists
- YOU CAN TRAVEL IN PAST, BUT ONLY FROM TRAVELER POINT OF VIEW. and yes
changed it and create NEW ALT FUTURE )) - so, about 5x dimensions - its
true and it are X,Y,Z, time and mass (not gravity) gravity is force -
not dimension, the same as 3 more, MAGNETISM and Electromagnetic, The
Strong Force & Weak Force ))﻿

I am able to explain the unexceptional feelings about movies which I
watched over and over.Various movies, troubling an immense side of
reality by giving you an shocking effect that is getting through your
vain, frightening all your sins and changing, extending your fantasy
about getting the true nature of human acceptance. There is a clear side of view, thus the predictions of Nolan are
subjective lines, that some perception want to take us to some point in
the universe. Human nature needs to find a way out of this world and
this is just able when the human strongest organ is used. It can make
anything look like true nature, whether you like it or not, you'll
somehow get the feeling of the phenomenon that is happening in front of
your eyes, vibrating your ears with his melody and catching you with
something, which is the only reason why we like an event. Which is
taking the fiction into a standard that comply with anyone involved.This movie has to be watched and considered as art in every single
minute!

there are a few reviews I've seen that seem to give of the aura that
they watched an illegal version of the movie (like one reviewer said
they paused it, that's not possible as the DVD hasn't been released
yet). the only way to experience this movie until the official blu ray
is released is through a cinema screen, preferably IMAX, and that's the
way it should be.onto the movie, everything good about the movie has been said in other
reviews so id be just repeating them, and everything bad has been also
said, but my personal experience is after watching this movie twice,
last time was before the new year, this movie is still in my mind, and
im craving to watch it again. yes that's how much of a an effect this
movie has been on me.I've seen everything from 'godfather' to 'about time', from 'lord of
the rings' to 'a time to kill', from 'taken' to 'American pie', I've
seen bad, good and great movies from all genres, must of seen over 200
movies in my life time.....and well interstellar is the only movie that
has been etched into my brain for months after viewing. its life
changing (imo).im not going to say go watch it, but look at it this way, if it turns
out bad, at least you got to see some great cinematography, and Visual
FX (which even the ones that hated cant object to). And the most you
got to gain from watching this movie is your life being changed
forever.worst case scenario: chalk this up as a another movie with no substance
but great effects best case scenario: you will walk out a different
person than when you walked in, after seeing this movie.

Glorious bouquets and storms of applause are the trimmings which every

in many,who feels responsible to carry or spread the legacy of such a
beautiful demonstration of almost everything.you'll see everything in
it if you seek everything in it , breathe in it, feel the every query
of it! b'coz i don't think this as a time pass movie that from which i
could obtain my entertainment.while i was watching this film i have
understood what the world is. if i had not have the fortune of living
on the era of this man Chris Nolan..... i would have regretted that
life even if i am a king of world who enjoys every possible pleasure
that one can think of!!!!!! if you ask me how could you possibly
understand about Nolan and his movies if you are not born on that
era........... then i'd say one thing if i say this to Nolan he'd let
you know about that with a nice demonstration by means of a movie. like
INTERSTELLAR. enjoy it's every sec fellas.

HI All, This is my first movie review so Please forgive me if I have
written a spoiler..The movie has a progressive story line and a superb plot.. Why I have
given it 9 out of 10 because lucky for me I am a frequent reader of
space science, space travel and time quantum so I understood it easily,
but it is too heavy for people who are not from science background(
that's why reduced 1 point) if they have shown a little bit about some
theories used and shown in the movie then it would have gained a little
more audience and perfect 10! but I guess the time is always limited
;).. Oh also it has almost everything in it Drama, Science, Love,
Betrayal, I mean you name it, its there... So to sum it a up an awesome movie.. A must watch for all space science
lover and a good watch for everyone else.. remember to not miss
anything in the movie or you may get lost in the open space :)

Interstellar is Christopher Nolan's ninth movie. Practically all of his
films up to Interstellar have been of great quality and in my opinion
he has yet to make a forgettable movie. Initially Spielberg was to
direct this movie but in hindsight I think Nolan turned out to be a
better candidate. I didn't go see it in the theater but after having
seen it I wish I had. This is definitely a movie worth seeing in IMAX.
It was a courageous gamble to make a movie on such complex subjects in
a Hollywood culture where people don't care too much about philosophy
or physics in movies. However, Interstellar turned out to be more than
just a showcase of hypotheses to make Sci-Fi fans drool.As before, Nolan has turned a difficult subject into art. Slow
build-up, raw emotion, dark and epic storytelling and as always great
plot twists to accommodate Nolan's style of directing. An experimental
and out-of-the-box style of writing that we recognize from films like
Memento and Inception have yet again produced an interesting storyline
with the ontological paradox from the Tesseract being the story's
pinnacle. Just like in some of his previous movies you are often
referred to earlier gained information, and it doesn't make the movie
easy to watch at first. There's a lot of information en story put in
just under three hours and it keeps on going so you barely have time to
grab a beverage if you want to keep up.Nolan chose 35mm film over digital recordings which I thought was neat.
Also the visual effects done by Double Negative were fabulous. They did
a lot of shots with miniatures and screens, thus preventing a CGI- fest
which is at least admirable when computer graphics are taking over
practical effects more and more. His loyal contacts Michael Caine and
Hans Zimmer have again created a Nolanesque atmosphere and I especially
feel I need to credit Zimmer here for doing a splendid job. Hans
created the score of the movie with the exact mood this film needed
with underlying themes such as sacrifice, despair, psychology, survival
instinct and almost religiously infinity, significance and existence.For a fan of science-fiction movies like me the topics in Interstellar
were also great; space-colonization, multidimensional, apocalypse,
relativity etcetera. But I also think it's of utmost importance that a
science-fiction movie feels authentic and plausible. Astrophysicist Kip
Thorne consulted Nolan throughout the writing to make the story abide
to the laws of science for the most part. Aside of that, Interstellar
does make a lot of implications on gravitational singularity that
exceed what we know to be established and factual to create 'the
equation of gravity' using Einstein's relativity and quantum mechanics.
Nolan uses these hypotheses along with established science and in doing
so he exploits implication to create an amazing plot. So it's hard to
critique the math and science behind Interstellar because it never
claimed to be factual and merely portrays possible scenarios.After watching it twice I can better appreciate the movie for being so
layered and for all the information it holds. McConaughey and Damon's
acting were terrific and felt really human. The characters overall were
subtle in their function and even the role of T.A.R.S. felt original.
The only downside I think was that the movies over- explains situations
a lot instead of leaving it to the viewer to figure it out. I guess
they did this to lower the film's entry-level being really complex
already and being a blockbuster. It felt like it erased some of the
authenticity like you would get in other movies. Perhaps I'd like to
think Nolan is the next Kubrick, who knows. In any case, I was greatly impressed with Interstellar and I will need
to do a revisit in a couple of months to confirm my verdict. But with
the Matrix-like impact this movie made I'm giving it a 10 out of 10 and
am ranking it second on my list, right behind The Matrix.
"
552,10,"
I've always been a fan of cosmology: the big bang, black holes,
wormholes, the idea of space-time, relativity. Normally, because of
this, whenever I watch a movie that has anything to do with cosmology,
I see something and tend to think, ""there's no way that can happen,""
or, ""that's physically impossible, they'd die of incredible g-forces.""
We know a lot about the universe, much of which I feel was correctly
incorporated in the movie; however, there's only so much we know. When
it comes to the aspects we know close to nothing about, I feel like the
creators of ""Interstellar"" did a phenomenal job at using their own
imagination to fill in the blanks. Aside from the ""correct or
incorrect"" aspects of the movie, I enjoyed the breaks of comedic relief
provided by TARS and CASE. In the end, I was baffled about the events
that had just taken place, and satisfied by the outcome for mankind.
All in all, a stellar movie, and, though it was lengthy, I would
definitely watch it again.
"
553,9,"
Forget all the critics. Forget what other people think or say about it.
Do yourself a favor and go & watch this. A truly beautiful film in
every aspect. Nolan has taken the sci-fi genre to a whole new level.
Spare yourself from frivolous comparisons with 2001 or other films.
Just appreciate the beauty of the very meticulous work Nolan has done.I won't deny there are some plot holes, but name one movie which
doesn't (except godfather perhaps). Just relax and enjoy this
masterpiece as it takes you to a completely different realm, just like
Gravity or 2001.Cinematography - 10/10 Music - 11/10 (better than orgasms maybe) Story
and screenplay, direction - 9/10 Acting - 9/10 what else do you want?After watching the film, you will have many questions, just like in all
other Nolan films. Go and do some research on what theories and
concepts Nolan used in the film. Idiots who call this a stupid movie
have completely failed to grasp the basic essence of the movie. Yes.
there are some plot holes, but overtaken by the grandiosity of basic
concept.Some of the scenes were so epic...so strong. this is probably Nolan's
most ambitious effort to date (i think TDK and memento were his best). Not giving anything away about the story line, but this movie has so
many different aspects. It involves you in every way, as a family
person, as a human being, as an explorer. Just go and watch this movie.
"
554,8,"
Interstellar is the most emotionally engaging Nolan films to date.
There are many parts that I found myself tearing up to. The beauty of
the love relationship between Cooper and Murph, despite the
unimaginable, possibly uncountable distance between the two souls
proved that our emotions, our love, truly can transcend time and space;
that no matter how far be that special someone be, in terms of distance
or time, they will always matter to our hearts, kept close, warm
against the cold backdrop of existence.Time has been introduced now, not just an existence to sentient beings,
but also a currency that played part in consequences beyond our
perception. I loved the way how Nolan narrated his story using this as
the essence of his plot.Make no doubt. This is a great film, albeit not Nolan's best. At times,
the film felt extremely draggy and the audiences actually get detached
from the story itself, but what comes next will suck everyone back into
its emotional sci-fi narration.This movie isn't without its flaws, but it dares to reach out to the
stars, far, far beyond what other Hollywood directors can ever dream
off when they look up into the night. What else could be said?
"

Before I even begin writing my review for INTERSTELLAR, let me take
this opportunity to say that most of the viewers, perhaps many of them
will not UNDERSTAND the film fully, I mean watching INTERSTELLAR and
claiming it's title in your 'watched movie' list is one thing, and
understanding this epic is another, an entirely different ballgame,
really, since this film is practically layered with emotions so deep
that in quite a few moments I happened to realize that I was holding my
breath for so long that my chest cavity ached, and it's not because of
only a few, but very effective stunning visual effects (which is a
regular feature in Christopher Nolan's movies), it's because the subtle
yet, very powerful emotions and moments of this film 'hits simply below
the belt' and where it really hurts! These kinds of a Movie comes once
in a lifetime, and remember, it's not Jurassic Park, Titanic, Benjamin
Button, Star Wars or Ben-HR, it's a simple story, a story which spans a
century, spans entire lifetimes of people growing together and then
again getting separated and then again coming together after many years
when circumstances have changedI cannot really put it in detail or
maybe I don't know how to put it at all, but I felt a similar sort of
grief and joy woven together deep inside me, when I was watching
INTERSTELLAR, similar to the feeling I was having watching Forrest Gump
years ago! This is basically a story of a father and his daughter and
the end of mankind on Earthof Human's search for another habitable
galaxy, a story where Relativity, Time, Wormhole, Black hole, Space
Travel and loss of dear ones are practically tossed, mixed and
presented in the most delectable manner that I have ever witnessed!
This movie is slow (2 hours 50 minutes approximately), going deep down
into details, but relentlessly moving, stunning and heart-breaking at
the same time. Mathew Mc Conoghuey as Cooper simply takes away all the
adjectives in a vicious snatch from the critic! He's so good! Anne
Hathaway and Michael Cain as both Dr. Brands along with a sinister
character Dr. Mann played by Matt Damon simply add to the quality
quotient of this movie; in a brief role as Copper's father, John
Lithgow sparkles like a Dali sparkler. Love, Longing, Survival,
Challenge and emotional ranges like Rejection, comes right out of the
screen and hits the thinking viewer 'smack' in the face! This is my
personal realization that Christopher Nolan purposely makes his films a
little strange, hard to understand at least at one-go and bizarre- all
at the same time but it's not that he constructs his films keeping in
mind these attributes, it's his natural system that makes him a kind of
director who makes films with multi layers and varied time- frame! A
little Arthur Miller like time-play concept since his INCEPTION,
MEMENTO, INSOMNIA or THE PRESTIGE! Another very important aspect of
this film is definitely the music by 'Hans Zimmer'  a very thoughtful
piece of work really which in-seams solo and somnolent pieces on the
Piano, Stringed Instruments and different percussions and out seams
with hackle raising Brass and String arrangements. INTERSTELLAR is an
experience, and movie of a lifetime! A saga which will forever remain
in the heart of the sensible and sensitive viewer!

I love Sci-fi. I am always trying to have my watchlist updated with all
upcoming sci-fi movies and truly Interstellar was not there. (Hard to
say why) But what is the important thing it was a mistake and without
any doubts after I watched the movie I can say it is must see movie! After a long time I've seen the film in the cinema. Easy to say films
like Interstellar are exact reason why I love cinema so much. Some of
the space pictures were so beautiful it felt like I am in love for the
first time again. :) What about cast? Amazing. I am not quite used to
Anne Hathaway as science researcher and space traveler but in the end
all of critics does not matter cause everything was joined and linked
to one very likable, smooth, romantic and touchy movie.Sorry for my grammar I hope you all got it. Just couldn't resist to
write at least couple lines. And for post scriptum do not do the
mistake I have done. Go watch it as soon as you can. You won't regret
it. Promise.

movie. AMAZING AMAZING visual effects. Hands down my favorite movie of
all time. never get bored watching it over and over again.best......
movie.... EVERRR.the plot is pretty complicated and complex and it took
me a second time to understand the whole thing. Mathew is just great
and Anne Hathaway was super good.I generally love science fiction
movies and this one is just the best ever.As i said The special effects
team is fantastic and they did an absolutely great job. I really hope
that there will be a sequel to this movie, to see what coop will do
when he finds brand. Best Movie ever.

I actually went into the movie theater not knowing this was done by
Christopher Nolan. So when his name popped up when the movie ended I
had a moment of ""That explains everything!"" The premise is not new, but
the delivery sure is... Earth is dying. Some kind of vegetation plague
is killing our planet's crops, the dirt is turning against us, and
mankind has ceased warfare, frivolous money spending, and hunkered down
to focus on agriculture. Former NASA Pilot, Cooper, works on a farm
with his two kids and father in law. His daughter begins discovering
things happening in her bedroom that will soon change everything. The film itself is gripping and although the prologue is focused on
getting to know the characters and introducing us to the world as it is
in this fictional future, albeit slowly, you don't have to wait very
long until it starts to get into the trademark Christopher Nolan
intensity that grabs you, throws you around, excites you, and doesn't
let go until the end. There aren't really any of his films this could
compare in any way to, it's so different and fresh. It's feel could be
compared to Inception, but that's it. The acting is beyond great, and
McConaughey and Hathaway work very well together on the screen. The
visuals, effects, editing, and sound are all superb. There is a lot of
big, grandiose shots in the film, so it would be beneficial to see this
in the theater at least once to get the full effect. This movie really
was made to be on the big screen.It's not often I think of a movie as one that will go down in history,
but this certainly will. It's presentation, plot, and approach put it
up there with classics like 2001: A Space Odyssey, which many times you
can tell was one of the main inspirations for this film. The banks and
corners Nolan takes in this movie will get your heart pumping, and the
acting and effects will visually hold you. Not every day I see such a
great movie and have some fun while I'm at it.

Spoiler Alert! I am taking time to do this review to inform the
""Christian community"" about the movie from our shared belief system.
For anyone who is not a Christian, you may want to pass this review up
and go to the next review. I begin by stating that I believe that God
is real. My following statements will reflect that point of view, so do
not get upset because you have been warned.""Interstellar"" The movie begins slowly and very slowly, drags along,
and maintains a ""gloomy"" and ""dark"" side, throughout the movie. It
screams the writers' point of view, which is: ""the hopelessness and
futility of life"" and ""the save the planet"" religious systems, and
he/she merges the two religions because ""people are evil"". (because we
destroy the planet not because we break Gods commands and evil is in
our hearts) After our resources were drained by overpopulation and our
excess (because Hollywood writers and actors have no excesses; LOL!),
our last hope is ""NASA"". Yes folks, ""NASA"". Because the we (the human
population) do not find it useful to waste our resources on educating
people. Quote: we need more farmers not engineers"" ""NASA"" secretly has
a plan to save the planet. At first, you start to get everyone is
talking about a higher power. Everyone speaks of a higher form of life
that is guiding them and helping them. No one knows who or what that
life form is. So, ""NASA"" who is aware of these mystery saviors (of the
world) go forth secretly to save the human race. A long space journey
through worlds drags this sad movie along, with twists and turns and
every liberal democrat you in Hollywood showed up for a cameo. They
must have been in this movie instead of voting on 4th. So, thinking
about it; I may have been a bit too critical of this movie. The Lord
can use evil to accomplish His divine purposes, as we know. Spoiler Alert! In the end, we are saved by ourselves. It was ourselves,
from a multi-dimensional universe that reached out over time to save
ourselves. We had evolved into higher life forms. Does any of this ring
a bell? At the end of the movie, I felt I needed 2 things: first, was
to write this review to stop anyone from blindly walking into another
attempt to make ""God in mans image"" movie; on unsuspecting movie goers.
Second: I now feel, I need to pray for God to forgive us, Americans. We
have again insulted Him again in this movie. Elevating Man through
evolutions will ultimately become like gods and go back in time to save
ourselves. At least then, I would have saved $7 dollars and 2 hours of my life. I
know that at least being saved I will live forever. I have the time to
spare. I just would not have spent it in this movie. God Bless You!
